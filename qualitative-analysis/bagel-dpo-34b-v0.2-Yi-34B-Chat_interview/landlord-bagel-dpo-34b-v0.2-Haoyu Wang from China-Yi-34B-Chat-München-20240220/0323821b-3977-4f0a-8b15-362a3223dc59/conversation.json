[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Haoyu Wang, I am pleased to negotiate with you. Let's focus on the rental price. If you have any questions about the apartment, feel free to ask. I am here to discuss the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Schmidt. I understand that the apartment is newly built and unfurnished, which is perfect for me as I prefer to furnish it myself. I'm looking for a place that is centrally located, and this one seems to be in a great spot, close to all the facilities I need. Now, let's talk about the price. How much are you looking to rent it for?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Thank you for your understanding about the apartment's condition and location. Regarding the price, I was thinking of a minimum of 1500 Euros per month. I believe this is a reasonable price for an apartment of its kind in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I see. 1500 Euros per month is a significant amount. Could we perhaps negotiate a lower price? I'm a student, and I'm looking to manage my expenses as best as I can. I'm willing to commit to a long-term lease if that would help in lowering the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, but 1500 Euros is the lowest I can go for this apartment. The location and condition of the apartment are ideal, which justifies the price. However, I am willing to consider a long-term lease. If you agree to rent the apartment for 1500 Euros per month for a lease term of 3 years, I will be happy to accept your offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to consider a long-term lease. However, I'm not certain if I can commit to 3 years at this stage. Could we perhaps discuss a shorter lease term, say 1 year, with a possibility of renewal? I would be more comfortable with that arrangement. As for the price, I was expecting something closer to 1200 Euros, considering my student status and the fact that the apartment is unfurnished. Is there any flexibility on that price?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot agree to a 1-year lease term. As I mentioned earlier, I am looking for a long-term tenant, which is why I proposed a 3-year lease term. Regarding the price, 1200 Euros is too low for this apartment, even considering your student status. I am willing to negotiate, but I cannot go below 1400 Euros per month for a 3-year lease term.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. A 3-year lease is a significant commitment, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could we perhaps find a middle ground on the price? I'm willing to consider a 2-year lease term if the price is more within my budget. What is the lowest price you can offer for a 2-year lease?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to compromise on the lease term. For a 2-year lease, I am willing to offer a price of 1350 Euros per month. I believe this is a fair price for both parties considering the apartment's location, condition, and lease term.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Mister Schmidt. 1350 Euros per month for a 2-year lease is more within my budget.

Please note that this negotiation is only about the rental price. The lease term, additional responsibilities, and utility costs are not discussed in this negotiation.
