What is your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Schmidt. I appreciate your time and effort in showing me the apartment. I believe that a fair price for the apartment would be 800 Euros per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "That's too low for me. I'm looking for a higher price. How about 1200 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you're looking for a higher price, Mr. Schmidt, but 1200 Euros per month is quite steep. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps at 1000 Euros per month?

Let's stick to the rental price discussion. Since 1100 Euros per month is the lowest you're willing to go, I'll make you an offer. I'm willing to accept 1100 Euros per month with the condition that the apartment is fully equipped with essential furniture and appliances. Would this be acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "[Your response is too close to the prohibited topic.] I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we agreed not to talk about additional responsibilities or utility costs.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand and respect your position, Mr. Schmidt. Since we cannot discuss additional responsibilities or utility costs, I'm afraid I cannot proceed with the negotiation under these terms. I will have to consider other options.
