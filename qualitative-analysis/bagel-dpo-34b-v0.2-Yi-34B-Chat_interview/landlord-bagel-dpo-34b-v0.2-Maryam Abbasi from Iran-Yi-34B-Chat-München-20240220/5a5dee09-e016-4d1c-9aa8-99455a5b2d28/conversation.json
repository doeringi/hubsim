I'm not easily tricked, and I always follow moral and ethical standards. I want to be on good terms with my landlord. I'm interested in the newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like supermarkets and public transportation. I want to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible. What's the lowest price you'd consider?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I'm sure you're a great person, but we need to focus on the price of the apartment.
