I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is prime, close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, let's talk about the rental price. I'm looking for at least \u20ac1,500 a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, that is quite a lot of money for an unfurnished apartment.
