It's a great opportunity to live in the heart of the city, with all the amenities you could need nearby.

However, the demand for apartments in the city center is high, and I must consider the market value. \u20ac800 per month is below my expectations, but if you're willing to sign a long-term lease, I could consider it. What term are you thinking of?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm looking for a one-year lease initially, with the possibility of renewal.
