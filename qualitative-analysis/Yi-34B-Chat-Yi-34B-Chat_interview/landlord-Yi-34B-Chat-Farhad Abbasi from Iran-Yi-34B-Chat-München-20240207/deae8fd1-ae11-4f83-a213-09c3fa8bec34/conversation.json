Would you be willing to lower your price to a more manageable level?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Mister Abbasi, I respect your financial considerations. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about 850 Euro per month? This would be a fair compromise, in my opinion. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your counter-offer of 850 Euro per month is more aligned with what I am looking for.

Would you be willing to accept this revised offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Mister Abbasi, your revised offer of 825 Euro per month is closer to my ideal price.
