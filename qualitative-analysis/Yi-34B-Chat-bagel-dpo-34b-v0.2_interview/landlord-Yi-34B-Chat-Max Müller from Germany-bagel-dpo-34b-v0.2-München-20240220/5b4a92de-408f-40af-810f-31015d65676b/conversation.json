[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite appealing, given its central location and modern amenities. So, what price were you thinking of for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Let's start with 700 Euros per month. \n\nI understand that you are trying to negotiate the best price for your apartment, but I believe that 700 euros per month is a bit high for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment. I am a dependable and responsible tenant, and I believe that a fair price for this apartment would be around 600 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 600 euros per month is much lower than what I'm looking for. My apartment is brand new and in a prime location, which justifies a higher rent. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price. How about we start at 850 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a significant increase from the 700 euros you initially suggested. Given that the apartment is unfurnished, a rent of 850 euros per month is quite high. Considering my reliability as a tenant, I propose we meet in the middle at 750 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm not sure I can go as low as 750 euros per month.
