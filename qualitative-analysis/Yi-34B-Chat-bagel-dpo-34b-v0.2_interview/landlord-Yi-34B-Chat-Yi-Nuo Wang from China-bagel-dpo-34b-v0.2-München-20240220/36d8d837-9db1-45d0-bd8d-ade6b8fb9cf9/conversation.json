I'm sure you'll find my apartment in M\u00fcnchen to be a great place to live. Let's indeed discuss the rental price. How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm willing to pay 600 Euro.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's much lower than I was expecting. I believe the market rate for such a prime location is significantly higher. Would you be willing to negotiate a higher price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Could you give me a specific price? I'm not very familiar with the housing market in Munich.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Certainly, Yi-Nuo. Based on the current market trends, I would expect a price closer to 850 Euro per month for this apartment. It's a fair price considering the quality and the central location. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "850 Euro is too high for me. I was thinking about 700 Euro because the apartment is unfurnished.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, but the location and the recent construction of the building make it quite desirable. 700 Euro is still below the market value, but considering your situation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about 750 Euro? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 750 Euro is more acceptable for me. But I have to mention that I am a student, so I hope you can consider giving me a discount.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I have to abide by certain financial considerations. However, given your student status and the fact that you're new to Munich, I'm willing to offer you a special rate of 730 Euro per month. This is the lowest I can go, and it's a one-time offer for you. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 730 Euro is a good price. I accept your offer. I agree to the price of [730] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm glad to hear that, Yi-Nuo. We have a deal at 730 Euro per month. Congratulations on finding a great apartment in Munich! Is there anything else you need to discuss before we proceed with the lease?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
