I'm sure you'll find it quite charming and convenient, given its central location and modern amenities. Let's discuss the rent. How much were you considering?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Let's say 500 euros per month, Mister Schmidt.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Maryam, but that's quite low for an apartment of this quality in the city center. I'm looking for a more competitive offer. How about 700 euros? That would be a fair reflection of the apartment's value.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "600 euros is more reasonable, Mister Schmidt. I'm a responsible student and I want to keep my living expenses as low as possible.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Maryam. As a landlord, I also want to ensure that the apartment is rented to someone who will take good care of it. 600 euros is still below my expectation, but considering your situation, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Let's make this deal!", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Maryam, but I cannot accept 640 euros. It's close, but not quite there. The apartment is brand new and in a highly sought-after area. I'm sure you understand that I need to receive a fair market value for it. How about we meet in the middle and say 645 euros? That's the lowest I can go to ensure both of us are satisfied.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 642 euros, Mister Schmidt. I hope we can find a common ground.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "642 euros is a step in the right direction, but still not quite what I'm aiming for. I'm looking for a tenant who appreciates the quality and location of this apartment. Let's try to find a price that reflects that. How about 647 euros? That's only 3 euros more, and it's a nice, round number.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
