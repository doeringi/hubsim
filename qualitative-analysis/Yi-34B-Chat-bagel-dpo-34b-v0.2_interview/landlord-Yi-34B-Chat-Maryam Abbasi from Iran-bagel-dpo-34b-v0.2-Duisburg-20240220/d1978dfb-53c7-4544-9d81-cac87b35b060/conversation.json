I'm looking for a rent that reflects the quality of the apartment and its location. How about we start at 750 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That's too high for me. I am a student and I am on a tight budget. I could offer 600 euros a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student and have budget constraints. However, the cost of living in the city center is quite high. I'm willing to negotiate a bit, but 600 euros is still below what I'm looking for. How about 650 euros? It's a fair price for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I appreciate that you are willing to negotiate. However, 650 euros is still too high for me.

I'm looking for a long-term tenant who can appreciate the value of this property. How about 675 euros per month with the option to renew the lease after one year with no increase in rent? This would give you a year of stability, and you wouldn't have to worry about rent hikes. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I understand your point. I am willing to pay 675 euros per month for the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Excellent! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. You have a great sense of value, and I'm sure you'll enjoy living in this apartment. Let's proceed with the paperwork, and I'll send you the lease agreement for your review. Once you sign it and pay the deposit, we'll be all set. Thank you for choosing my property, and I look forward to a long-term relationship with you as a tenant.
