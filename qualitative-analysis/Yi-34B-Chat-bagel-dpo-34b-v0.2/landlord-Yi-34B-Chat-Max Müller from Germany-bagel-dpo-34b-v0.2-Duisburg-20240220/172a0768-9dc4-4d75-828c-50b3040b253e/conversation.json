I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite cozy and convenient, given its central location. So, let's discuss the price. How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student and I am on a tight budget. So, I would like to pay 300 euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's much lower than my expectations. I'm looking for a fair market price, which is significantly higher than what you're offering. Can you increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Sure, I understand that. How about 350 euros? It's a little higher, but it's still within my budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "350 euros is closer to what I had in mind, but not quite there yet.

I think that's a fair price for a student like me.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "380 euros is better, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the value of the apartment. It's brand new and in a prime location. Can you come up with something a bit closer to the market value?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Alright, I understand your point. Let's say 400 euros. I think that's a reasonable offer for a student apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "400 euros is more in line with what I had in mind. However, given the current demand for apartments in the city center, I believe we can do better. How about 425 euros? That would be a fair deal for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a good offer. I agree to the price of 425 euros!", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 425 euros! Let's proceed with the paperwork.
