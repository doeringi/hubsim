How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm interested in the apartment, but I'm looking for a fair price. I'm a student, and I need to be mindful of my expenses. How much are you asking for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, my goal is to get the highest price possible for my property. However, I understand that you're a student and may have budget constraints. What is your maximum budget for rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'd like to find a balance that works for both of us.

Is that within your budget?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 1500 Euros per month is quite high for me as a student.

While 1500 Euros per month is a steep amount for me, I'm willing to stretch my budget slightly for a great apartment like this. However, I'd like to propose 1400 Euros per month. This would be a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if the apartment meets my needs. Would you be willing to accept 1400 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but 1400 Euros per month is still below my asking price. The apartment is in a prime location and is newly built, which adds to its value. I believe 1500 Euros per month is a very fair price for both parties.
