I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. So, let's discuss the price. How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm looking for a fair price, considering the location and the amenities. I think 800 Euro per month would be reasonable. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Emilia, but 800 Euro per month is not enough for an apartment of this quality in the city center. I'm looking for a price that reflects the investment I've made in this property. How about 1000 Euro per month? Do you think that's more in line with the market value?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1000 Euro per month is higher than what I had in mind. I'm a student, so I'm on a budget. Could we negotiate a lower price? Perhaps 900 Euro per month? That would be more in line with what I can afford.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I have to consider the cost of maintenance and upkeep of the property. 900 Euro per month is still not sufficient for me to cover these expenses. How about we meet in the middle? 950 Euro per month would be a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, and I appreciate the middle ground you're suggesting. 950 Euro per month is more acceptable to me than 1000 Euro. I'll agree to that price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Excellent! I'm glad we could reach an agreement. I agree to the price of 950 Euro!
