I do believe that the apartment is a great fit for you. As a landlord, I would like to ensure that I am getting the best possible rental price for this property. Based on the size and location of the apartment, I was thinking that a monthly rental price of \u20ac800 would be fair.

As a landlord, I am willing to be flexible with the rental payment schedule. It is possible to pay the rent quarterly, but I would require a deposit of three months upfront to ensure that the rent is paid on time. This would give you more time to manage your finances and make payments as needed. Please let me know if this is something you are comfortable with, and we can discuss the details further.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
