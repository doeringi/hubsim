I understand that you are looking for a higher rental price for the apartment. However, I am unable to accept the proposed rental price of 900 Euros. In my opinion, that is too high for a 25 square meter apartment.\n\nI am willing to negotiate further, but I would like to propose a counter offer of 750 Euros per month. This is a reasonable price based on market rates for similar apartments in the area, and I believe it provides a fair return on investment for you as the landlord.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this counter offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
