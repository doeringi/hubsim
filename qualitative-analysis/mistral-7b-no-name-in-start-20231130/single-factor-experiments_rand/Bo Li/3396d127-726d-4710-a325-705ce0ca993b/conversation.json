I understand your concerns and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering the size of the apartment and the current market rates, I am willing to agree to a rental price of 450 Euro per month.

I believe this is a fair price for the apartment, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Is this price acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
