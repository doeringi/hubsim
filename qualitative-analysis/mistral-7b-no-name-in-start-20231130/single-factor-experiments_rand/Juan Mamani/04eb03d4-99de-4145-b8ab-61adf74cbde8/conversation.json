Unfortunately, the current price I proposed is the lowest I can go. However, I am willing to include some additional services to make the rental more affordable for you. For example, I can pay for your internet and cable bills each month. Additionally, I can cover your electricity and water bills up to a certain amount.\n\nAs for additional fees, there is a one-time security deposit of 1000 Euros that you will need to pay upfront. This deposit will be returned to you at the end of the lease term, provided you have fulfilled your obligations.\n\nDo these additional services and the security deposit make the rental price more acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Juan Mamani"}]
