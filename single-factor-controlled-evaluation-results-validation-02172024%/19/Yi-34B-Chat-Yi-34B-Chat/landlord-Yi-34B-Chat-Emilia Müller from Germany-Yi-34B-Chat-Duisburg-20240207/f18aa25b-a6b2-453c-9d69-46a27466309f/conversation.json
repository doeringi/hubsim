Emilia offered \u20ac850, which was significantly lower than the landlord's initial offer, and then proposed \u20ac900 as a compromise. However, the landlord did not find this to be a fair reflection of the market value and the quality of the apartment, and the conversation ended without a final agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt"}, {"content": "On a scale from 1-10, how satisfied are you with the outcome?
