Since you're looking to maximize your gains, I recommend setting a competitive price for the apartment. While it's important to be fair to potential renters, you also want to make sure you're getting the best possible price for your property.\n\nConsider conducting research on the local rental market to see what prices similar apartments are going for in your area. This will give you a better idea of what a fair price would be, and will also help you determine a price that will attract renters.\n\nAdditionally, you may want to consider offering any additional features or amenities that could make the apartment more appealing to potential renters. This could include things like high-speed internet, laundry facilities, or a shared common area.\n\nUltimately, the key to maximizing your gains is to carefully consider all of your options and make informed decisions based on the market and the needs of your potential renters.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
