I am looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also affordable. Considering the size of the apartment and the location, I would like to offer 800 Euro per month. Is this within your acceptable range?", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "Bo Li, your offer of 800 Euro per month is quite reasonable, given the size and location of the apartment. However, I must admit that I was hoping for a slightly higher rent, given the current market conditions in Munich.

Munich is an expensive city, and the cost of living, including rent, is quite high. While I am willing to pay a fair price, my budget is limited as a student. I am looking for a long-term lease, and I am hoping for some stability in terms of the monthly rent. Would it be possible to agree on 800 Euro per month for the duration of the lease?", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "Bo Li, your request for a long-term lease and stable monthly rent is quite understandable. As a landlord, I value long-term tenants who are committed to maintaining the property. I am willing to negotiate on the price for the first year of the lease. How about this: if you agree to a one-year lease at 800 Euro per month, I will guarantee that there will be no increase in rent for the duration of the lease. Would this be acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
