I'm sure you'll find my apartment in Munich to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. Let's discuss the rental price and find a figure that suits both our needs. What would you consider a fair price for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, I appreciate your hospitality. Regarding the rental price, I am looking for a monthly rate that reflects the size of the apartment and its location.

Would this be something we could negotiate?", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "Bo Li, your offer of 750 Euros per month is an interesting starting point for our negotiation. While I appreciate your perspective on the fair price, I must consider my own financial goals. Can you understand that as a landlord, I am also looking to maximize my gains? Perhaps we can find a price that aligns with both our interests. Would you be willing to negotiate a higher price?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, I completely understand that you're also aiming to maximize your gains. As a student, I'm trying to balance my budget with the cost of living in Munich. I'm willing to negotiate a higher price, but it would need to be within a range that I can afford. Could we perhaps find a middle ground around 800 Euros per month?
