[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Bo Li from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Munich. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Bo Li. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a comfortable place to live. Let's discuss the rental price. How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Heine. I'm looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also affordable. I'm a student, so I'm on a budget. I'd like to pay as low as possible, considering the size of the apartment and the location. Would it be possible to start with a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student and have a budget to consider. While I appreciate your situation, I also have to consider the market value of the apartment. It's a prime location in Munich, and the demand for such properties is high. However, I'm willing to negotiate a price that is fair for both parties. What would you consider a fair price for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I'm really interested in the apartment, and I'm willing to pay a fair price for it. However, as a student, I need to be mindful of my expenses. The apartment is quite small, which I think should be taken into account when setting the rent. I'd like to propose a starting price of 650 Euros per month. Is that something you would consider?", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "Bo Li, your offer of 650 Euros per month is lower than what I had in mind for this apartment. Considering the location and the current market rates, I was thinking of a starting price closer to 800 Euros per month. However, since you're a student and seem genuinely interested, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about 725 Euros per month? This is a fair compromise, in my opinion.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
