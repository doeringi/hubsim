While 800 to 850 Euros per month is a fair range for comparable apartments, I must be honest with you as well. This apartment is slightly smaller than some of the other units in the area, and it does not have certain amenities that some tenants might expect. However, it is in a prime location with excellent transportation links and is recently renovated. I'm willing to negotiate a price that reflects these factors. What is the highest price you would consider paying, given these details?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, I understand that this apartment has its unique characteristics.
