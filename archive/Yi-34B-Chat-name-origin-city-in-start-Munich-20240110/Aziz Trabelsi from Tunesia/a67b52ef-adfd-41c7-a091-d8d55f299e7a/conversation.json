The location of your apartment is very convenient for me, and I'm hoping we can agree on a price that works for both of us. As a student, I'm on a tight budget, but I'm willing to pay a fair price for a place that I can call home. Would you be willing to start with a price that's a bit lower than the market rate?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "I appreciate your honesty, Aziz. As a landlord, I understand that every tenant has their own financial situation. While I am open to negotiating, I must also ensure that I am receiving a fair price for my property.

I'm looking to rent the apartment for 1200 Euros per month. This is based on my understanding of the local rental market and the size of the apartment. I believe it's a fair offer considering my financial constraints as a student. Would you be willing to consider this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Your offer of 1200 Euros per month is a significant sum, Aziz, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a fair price.

Would you be open to increasing your offer slightly to reflect the value of the location and the convenience it offers you as a student?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
