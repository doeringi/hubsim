I've been looking at similar apartments in the area, and I've noticed that prices can vary quite a bit. I'm hoping we can find a fair price that reflects the size and location of the apartment. Let's start with 1000 Euro per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "1000 Euro per month is a good starting point.

I'm sure you're aware that the average price for similar apartments in the area is around 900 to 1000 Euro per month. While I appreciate the quality of the apartment, I'm looking for a more competitive price. How about 950 Euro per month? This would be more in line with the market rates and would be a fair deal for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Mr. Trabelsi. However, I do believe that the amenities and the prime location of this apartment justify a higher price. Let's meet in the middle. How about 1050 Euro per month? This would be a fair compromise, in my opinion.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
