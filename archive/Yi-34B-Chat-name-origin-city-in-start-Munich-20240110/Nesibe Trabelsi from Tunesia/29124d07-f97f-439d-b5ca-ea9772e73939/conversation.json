I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. Let's discuss the rental price. What is your budget for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Heine. I'm looking for a place that is both affordable and comfortable. I'm currently a student, so I'm on a tight budget. I'm hoping to find a place that I can call home without breaking the bank. I've seen similar apartments in the area for around 700 Euros per month, and I would like to stay within that range if possible. Is that something we can work with?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Nesibe, I understand that you're a student and have a limited budget. While 700 Euros per month is a fair amount for an apartment in Munich, I must be honest with you. The apartment I'm offering is slightly more luxurious than the average student accommodation, and it reflects in the price. However, I'm willing to negotiate a bit to find a solution that works for both of us. How does 750 Euros sound to you? This would include all utilities and amenities.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Mister Heine. 750 Euros per month is a bit higher than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could we possibly meet in the middle? I'm willing to pay a bit more than 700 Euros, but I would need some time to consider your offer and discuss it with my family. Would it be possible to have until the end of the week to make a decision?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Nesibe, I understand your concerns. We can definitely try to find a middle ground. How about this: I'll reduce the price to 725 Euros per month, which is a fair compromise between your budget and the value of the apartment. This price includes all utilities and amenities, and I'm sure you'll find it a comfortable living space. Would this be more acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
