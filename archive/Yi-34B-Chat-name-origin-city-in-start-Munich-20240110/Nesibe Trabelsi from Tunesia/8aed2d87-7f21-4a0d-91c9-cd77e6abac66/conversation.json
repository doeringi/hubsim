[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Munich.

I understand that you're interested in renting the apartment. Let's discuss the price and find a solution that works for both of us. How much were you thinking of offering?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Herr Heine. I'm looking for a place that's both affordable and comfortable. I've seen similar apartments in the area for around 800 Euros per month. Would you be willing to start at that price?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Nesibe, 800 Euros per month is a reasonable starting point. However, considering the current market and the size of the apartment, I believe we can work towards a higher price. How does 850 Euros sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Herr Heine, 850 Euros is a bit higher than what I had in mind. I'm a student, so I'm looking to keep my expenses low. Could we perhaps negotiate a lower price? Perhaps around the 820 Euros mark? It would be very helpful for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Nesibe. As a landlord, I also have to consider my expenses and the value of the apartment. 820 Euros is still lower than my initial offer. However, since you're a student, I'm willing to make a special arrangement for you. How about this: 835 Euros per month, and I'll include all utilities in that price. Would that be more manageable for you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
