Let's discuss the price. How much were you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Heine. I'm looking for a place that is both affordable and convenient. I was hoping to find something around 650 Euros per month, all inclusive. Would that be possible for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Nesibe, your budget seems reasonable. However, given the prime location and the recent renovations, I was thinking a bit higher. How does 700 Euros sound to you? This includes all utilities and amenities.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, I appreciate your offer, but as a student, I'm on a tight budget. I'm really looking to minimize my expenses. Would it be possible to negotiate a bit lower? Perhaps around 675 Euros? This would still be a fair deal for both parties, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Nesibe, I understand your financial concerns. Let's find a balance that works for both of us. How about this: if you are willing to commit to a one-year lease, I could offer you the apartment for 685 Euros per month.
