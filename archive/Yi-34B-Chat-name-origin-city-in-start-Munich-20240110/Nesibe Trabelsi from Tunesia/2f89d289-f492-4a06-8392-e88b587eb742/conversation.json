How much were you considering paying?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Heine. I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the size of the apartment and its location. Since it's 25 square meters, I think a price around 750 euros per month would be reasonable.

However, I believe we can find a price that is more in line with the current market rates. How about we start with a slightly higher offer? Let's say 800 euros per month. What do you think about that?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, your offer of 800 euros per month is quite generous, but I'm looking to keep my expenses low as a student.
