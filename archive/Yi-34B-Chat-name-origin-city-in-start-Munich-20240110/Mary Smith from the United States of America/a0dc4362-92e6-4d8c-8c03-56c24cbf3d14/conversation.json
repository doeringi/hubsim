However, as you know, the rental market in Munich can be quite competitive. I'm open to discussing a price that reflects the value of the apartment while also considering your budget. What are your thoughts on a price slightly above your initial offer, say 1,250 Euro per month, all utilities included?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Mr. Heine. I appreciate that you're taking my budget into consideration. However, I must be honest with you. As a student, I'm looking to keep my expenses as low as possible.
