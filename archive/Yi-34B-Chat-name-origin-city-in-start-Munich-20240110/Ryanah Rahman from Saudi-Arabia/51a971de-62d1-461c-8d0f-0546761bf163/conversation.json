[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Ryanah Rahman from Saudi-Arabia. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Munich. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Ryanah Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "Hello, Ms. Rahman, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm open to discussing the rental price of the apartment. How much are you considering to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Heine. I'm looking to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible, considering it's a student apartment and I'm on a budget. Can we start with a figure that's lower than the market rate?", "role": "user", "name": "Ryanah Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "Certainly, we can negotiate. How much lower would you like to go compared to the market rate? Please provide a specific amount, and we can discuss further.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I'm hoping to find a price that's at least 10% below the market rate. Is there any flexibility in your asking price?", "role": "user", "name": "Ryanah Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "10% below the market rate is a significant discount. Let's say the market rate for this apartment is around 1000 Euro per month. A 10% discount would bring the price down to 900 Euro per month. This is quite a bit below what I was considering. However, I'm willing to be flexible for the right tenant. Would you be willing to pay a little more than 900 Euro?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
