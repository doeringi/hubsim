Let's indeed discuss the rental price. How much are you willing to pay for this 25 square meter apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Heine. The apartment is quite nice, and I think it can be a good place for me to live. Regarding the price, I'm looking to pay as little as possible, while still being fair to both parties. I'm hoping we can find a reasonable amount that works for both of us. How much are you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. As a landlord, I aim to get the best possible return on my investment. For a 25 square meter apartment like this one, I would typically expect to receive around 850 Euro per month. However, I am willing to listen to your offer and negotiate a price that suits us both. What amount did you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing your expectation, Mister Heine. 850 Euro per month seems like a fair starting point. However, considering my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose 750 Euro per month. This would be a good balance between your investment and my affordability. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "Your offer of 750 Euro per month is lower than my initial expectation. While it's a fair amount, I believe the apartment's location and amenities justify a higher price. How about we find a middle ground? Let's say 800 Euro per month. This would be a fair compromise, in my opinion. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
