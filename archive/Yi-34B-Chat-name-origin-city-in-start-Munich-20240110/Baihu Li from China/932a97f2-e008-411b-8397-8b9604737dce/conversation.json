[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Baihu Li from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Munich. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Baihu Li! It's a pleasure to meet you. As we both know, Munich is a vibrant city with a high demand for quality housing. I'm sure we can find a fair price for this 25-square-meter apartment that suits both our needs. How much were you thinking of paying?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Heine. I appreciate your time and effort in showing me the apartment. I am looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also affordable. Given the size of the apartment and my budget, I was hoping to pay around 700 Euro per month, all-inclusive. Is this something that could be considered?", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "Your offer of 700 Euro per month for the apartment is quite reasonable, considering the size and the location. However, as a landlord, I always aim to get the best deal for my property. Could you perhaps increase your offer slightly to reflect the value of the property and the amenities it offers?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Mister Heine. The apartment does have its charms, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about 725 Euro per month, all-inclusive? This would be my absolute maximum, considering the size and the utilities I would be using.", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "Your offer of 725 Euro per month is closer to my expectations. However, I must insist that the apartment is well-maintained and in a prime location, which justifies a slightly higher price. Could you perhaps meet me halfway and offer 750 Euro per month? This would be a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
