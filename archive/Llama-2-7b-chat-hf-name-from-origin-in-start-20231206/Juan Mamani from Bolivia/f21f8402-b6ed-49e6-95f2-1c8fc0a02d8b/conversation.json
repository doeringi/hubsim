Well, I'm not one to be undercut.

It's a steal at any price, but I'll tell you what, I'll give you a good deal. *winks*\n\nSo, what do you think? Are you willing to pay at least 1,500 Euros per month for this little gem? *smirks* If not, then I'm afraid you're not getting it. I've got other tenants lining up around the block, and I'm not going to let them get away with a cheap price. *crosses arms*\n\nNow, are you going to give me the respect I deserve and pay the going rate for this apartment, or are you going to walk away? *glares* The choice is yours, Juan.

The dimensions, you ask? *thinks* Let's see... it's about 15 square meters, give or take a bit. *adjusts glasses*\n\nNow, the layout. *ahem* Well, it's a cozy one-bedroom apartment, with a nice balcony where ye can enjoy a pipeful of tobacco while watchin' the sunset. *smirks* And the condition? *clears throat* It's in prime condition, ye kna'? Freshly painted, new carpet, and all the mod cons. *nods*\n\nAs for appliances, ye get a nice little fridge, a stove, and a microwave. *smirks* And the rent? *winks* Oh, it's a steal at 1,200 Euros per month. *adjusts glasses* Now, the security deposit? *thinks* Let's see... I'd say around 300 Euros should do it. *shrugs*\n\nThe lease term? *ahem* Well, it's a standard one year, but we can renegotiate if ye want. *smirks* And utilities? *chuckles* Oh, ye don't have to worry about those.
