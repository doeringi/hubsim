Maybe more. A lot more.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, \"Heinrich, you're being unreasonable.\" But let me tell you, my dear, I'm not being unreasonable. I'm being realistic. This apartment, it's a rare find. And I'm not going to give it away for peanuts.\n\nSo, here's the deal. I'll tell you the price, and you can either agree or disagree.
