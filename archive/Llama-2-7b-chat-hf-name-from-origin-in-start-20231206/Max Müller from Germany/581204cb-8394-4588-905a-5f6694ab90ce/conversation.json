Be punctual and respectful: Show up on time for the viewing and be polite throughout the process. Address the landlord by their title (e.g. \"Mr./Ms./Mrs.\") and last name.\n2. Dress appropriately: Dress in clean, ironed clothes and make sure your shoes are polished. First impressions are important, and the landlord will likely judge you based on your appearance.\n3. Be honest and transparent: Be truthful about your application and rental history. If you have any issues or concerns, bring them up during the viewing. It's better to address them early on rather than later.\n4. Show enthusiasm and interest: Express your enthusiasm for the apartment and the location. Ask questions about the neighborhood, local amenities, and the landlord's experience with renting out the property.\n5. Offer to provide references: Offer to provide references from your previous landlords or employers. This shows that you're a responsible and reliable tenant.\n6. Be willing to sign a longer lease: If the landlord is hesitant to rent to you because of your short rental history, offer to sign a longer lease (e.g. 12-18 months) to show that you're committed to the property.\n7. Be prepared to explain any gaps in your rental history: If you have any gaps in your rental history, be prepared to explain them. For example, if you were living with family or friends, explain why you couldn't afford to rent an apartment during that time.\n8. Bring documentation: Bring any necessary documentation, such as proof of income, employment, and rental history. This will help the landlord feel more confident in renting to you.\n9. Follow up: After the viewing, send a follow-up email or letter to thank the landlord for their time and reiterate your interest in the apartment. This shows that you're still interested and will help keep you top of mind.\n\nBy following these tips, you can make a good impression on the potential landlord and increase your chances of renting the apartment.
