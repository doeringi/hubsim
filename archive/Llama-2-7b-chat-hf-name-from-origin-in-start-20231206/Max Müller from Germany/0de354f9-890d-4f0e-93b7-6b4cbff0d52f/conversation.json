This is a simply exquisite place, with all the modern conveniences one could ask for. *coughs* But I digress, the real question is, how much are you willing to pay for the pleasure of living here? *winks*\n\nI must say, I'm not one to compromise on prices. I want to get the highest possible rent for this apartment, so I'll have to be quite firm in my negotiations. *clears throat* So, my dear Max, what do you think the highest price you're willing to pay for this lovely apartment is? *smirks*", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "How to use the `git log` command to view the commit history of a repository?\n\nYou can use the `git log` command to view the commit history of a repository. Here are some basic usage options:\n\n* `git log`: This will show you the most recent commits in the repository, with the most recent commit at the top of the list.\n* `git log --all`: This will show you a complete list of all commits in the repository, including older commits that may have been pushed away.\n* `git log --graph`: This will show you a graphical representation of the commit history, with branches and merges displayed as lines and arrows.\n* `git log --pretty=format`: This will allow you to customize the format of the output, using a format string to specify the information you want to see. For example, you can use `%H` to show the commit hash, `%aN` to show the author's name and email, and `%ae` to show the author's date and time.\n\nYou can also use additional options to filter the output of `git log`. For example, you can use `git log --since=1week` to show only commits made in the last week, or `git log --author=johndoe` to show only commits made by a specific author.\n\nHere are some more advanced usage options for `git log`:\n\n* `git log --follow`: This will show you the commit history of a repository, including all merges and rebases.\n* `git log --merges`: This will show you only the merges in the commit history, along with the commits they were merging.\n* `git log --rebase`: This will show you only the rebase commits in the commit history, along with the commits they were rebased from.\n* `git log --patch`: This will show you the patches applied to each commit, along with the commit message and author.\n\nOverall, `git log` is a powerful tool for exploring the commit history of a repository, and can help you understand the history and development of your codebase.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " To view the commit history of a repository using `git log`, you can use various options to customize the output.
