This shows that you're willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.\n9. Bring references: If you have solid references from previous landlords or employers, bring them along to the viewing. This can help demonstrate your reliability and responsibility.\n10. Follow up with a small gift: After the viewing, consider sending a small gift or token of appreciation to the landlord.
