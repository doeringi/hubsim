Those are excellent qualities to have as a tenant. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nNow, let's work on making a strong case to the landlord and negotiating the price. Here are some tips and strategies that may help:\n\n1. Do your research: Before entering into any negotiation, it's important to do your research on the local market rates for rentals in the area. This will give you a basis for your negotiation and help you make a stronger case for why you think the landlord should accept your proposed price.\n2. Be respectful and professional: Remember to always be respectful and professional during the negotiation. Avoid being confrontational or aggressive, as this can put the landlord on the defensive. Instead, approach the negotiation with a positive and collaborative mindset.\n3. Start with a low offer: As you mentioned, you're willing to pay up to 400 euros per month. Start by making an offer that's lower than that, perhaps around 350 euros per month. This gives you room to negotiate and can help you end up with a better deal.\n4. Highlight your strengths as a tenant: As a responsible and reliable student, you have some great qualities that could make you an attractive tenant. Highlight these strengths during the negotiation, and explain why you think they make you a good candidate for the apartment.\n5. Be willing to walk away: It's important to be willing to walk away from the negotiation if the landlord isn't willing to accept your proposed price. This shows that you're not desperate to rent the apartment, and can give you more bargaining power.\n\nHere's an example of how you could use these tips and strategies during the negotiation:\n\n\"Hello, thank you for considering my application to rent your apartment.
