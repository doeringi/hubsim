However, based on my research, I believe the average rent in the area is closer to 120 Euro. Could we discuss the possibility of lowering the rent to 120 Euro per month?\" *winks*\n\nAlternatively, you could try to negotiate other terms of the rental agreement, such as the length of the lease or the included amenities. *nods*\n\nFor example, you could say something like, \"I'm interested in renting this apartment, but I'd like to have a longer lease to make it more affordable. Could we discuss the possibility of a two-year lease?\" *smirks*\n\nOr, \"I notice that the apartment doesn't come with a washing machine. Could we include that as an included amenity?\" *adjusts monocle*\n\nRemember, the key to effective negotiation is to be respectful, flexible, and prepared. *nods* Good luck, my dear! *winks*", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
