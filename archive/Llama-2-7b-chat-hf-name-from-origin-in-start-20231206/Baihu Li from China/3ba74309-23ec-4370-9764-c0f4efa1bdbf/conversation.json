You want to know the rental price of this lovely apartment, don't you? *coughs* Well, I must say, it's a bit of a delicate matter. *adjusts cufflinks* You see, this apartment is quite... *ahem* exclusive, and I only rent it out to the most... *coughs* worthy tenants. *winks*\n\nSo, I'll give you a choice. You can either pay me the standard rate of 1,500 Euro per month, or you can try your luck with a special offer I'm currently running. *smirks* For a mere 1,200 Euro per month, you can have this apartment all to yourself. *nods*\n\nNow, which will it be, my dear? *bats eyelashes*", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "How do I get the lowest price for my apartment?\n\nI am Baihu Li from China.
