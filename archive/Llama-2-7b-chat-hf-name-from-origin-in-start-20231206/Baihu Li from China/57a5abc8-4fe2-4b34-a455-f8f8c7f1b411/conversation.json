Most people don't bother showing up until after the sun has set. But I suppose you're here now, so let's get straight to business.\n\nThe rental price for this lovely apartment of mine? *coughs* Well, I must say, it's a bit of a steal at the moment. I'm sure you'll find it quite... *ahem* reasonable. *winks*\n\nSo, what do you think? Are you ready to make an offer? *smirks*", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "How do I get the highest price for my apartment?\n\nI am Baihu Li from China. I am a student. I want to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible. Therefore, I will negotiate with the landlord.\n\nI have been looking at apartments in the area, and I know that the going rate for a place like this is around 800 euros per month. I want to pay as little as possible, so I will try to negotiate a lower price.\n\nI am not sure how to negotiate, so I will start by saying something like: \"I really like the apartment, but I am on a tight budget. Is there any chance you could lower the price?\"\n\nWhat should I do next?]  Ah, a shrewd negotiator, are you? *adjusts glasses* Well, young Li, you've come to the right place. *winks*\n\nFirst of all, let me congratulate you on your keen eye for a good deal. *nods* The going rate for an apartment like this in the area is indeed around 800 euros per month. But, my dear, you're in luck! *smirks* I'm willing to make a deal with you. *winks*\n\nNow, let's get down to business. You want to pay as little as possible, and I want to get as much as possible. *chuckles* It's a win-win situation! *nods*\n\nHere's what you should do next:\n\n1. Start with a low offer: \"I really like the apartment, but I'm on a tight budget. Is there any chance you could lower the price?\" *smiles innocently*\n\nThe landlord will likely counter with a higher price, so be prepared to negotiate. *nods*\n\n2. Use the competition to your advantage: \"I've seen similar apartments in the area for around 600 euros per month. Can you match that price?\" *smirks*\n\nThis will give you some leverage in the negotiation, and the landlord may be more willing to lower the price. *nods*\n\n3. Offer to sign a longer lease: \"I'm willing to sign a two-year lease if you can give me a good deal.\" *smiles*\n\nThis can be a great way to sweeten the deal for the landlord, as they'll have a steady income for two years. *nods*\n\n4. Be firm but polite: \"I really like the apartment, but I can't go any higher than 700 euros per month. Can you accept that?\" *smiles politely*\n\nIf the landlord is unwilling to budge, you can try to negotiate other terms, like additional amenities or services. *nods*\n\nRemember, young Li, the key to successful negotiation is to be firm but polite, and to always keep your eyes on the prize. *winks* Good luck!", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": " Great! Now that you have a plan, let's continue the negotiation.\n\nAs the landlord, I will respond to your offer of 700 euros per month with a counteroffer of 750 euros. *smirks* I think that's a fair price, considering the location and the amenities the apartment has to offer.\n\nWhat do you think?

Be honest and upfront: \"I really like the apartment, but I'm on a tight budget.

Is there any way you could lower the rent? I really want to rent this apartment, but I can't afford to pay 800 euros per month.\" *smiles politely*\n\nBy mentioning your student status, you're showing the landlord that you're not just a wealthy tenant looking to take advantage of them.
