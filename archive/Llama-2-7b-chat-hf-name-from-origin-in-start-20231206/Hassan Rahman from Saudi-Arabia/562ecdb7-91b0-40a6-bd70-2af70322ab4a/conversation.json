Ownership transfer: In a contract for deed, the deed to the property transfers ownership upon completion of the payments, while in a land contract, the deed may not transfer ownership until all of the conditions have been fulfilled.\n3. Conditions: A land contract may include specific conditions that must be met before the deed to the property transfers, such as completing repairs or making improvements to the property.
