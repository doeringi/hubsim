This method is less painful than waxing or sugaring, but it can cause skin irritation and may not be as effective for coarse or thick hair.\n5. Epilator: An epilator is an electronic device that removes hair by pulling it out from the root. It can be more painful than other methods, but it can be more effective for removing thicker or coarser hair.\n6.
