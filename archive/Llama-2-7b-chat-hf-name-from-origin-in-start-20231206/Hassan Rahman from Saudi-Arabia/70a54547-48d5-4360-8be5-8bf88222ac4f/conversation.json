Nodes are the points where edges connect, and edges are the connections between nodes.\n\nA \"terminal\" node is a node that has no edges connecting to it, whereas a \"non-terminal\" node is a node that has at least one edge connecting to it.\n\nFor example, consider a graph with three nodes labeled A, B, and C. If node A has an edge connecting to node B, but not to node C, then node A is a non-terminal node, and node C is a terminal node.\n\nIn general, the distinction between terminal and non-terminal nodes is important in the study of graph theory because it can affect the properties of the graph, such as its connectivity and its ability to be colored with different colors.\n\nIn particular, a graph with only terminal nodes is called a tree, and a graph with only non-terminal nodes is called a cycle.\n\nIn summary, the key difference between a terminal and a non-terminal node in a graph is that a terminal node has no edges connecting to it, whereas a non-terminal node has at least one edge connecting to it.", "role": "user", "name": "Hassan Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": " Great!
