You want to know about the rental price, do you? *coughs* Well, I must say, it's a rather...um...expensive apartment. *adjusts monocle* It's a whopping 25 square meters, can you believe it? *chuckles* It's a real gem, if I do say so myself. *smirks*\n\nNow, as for the price...*clears throat* I was thinking of asking for at least...*pauses* 1000 Euro per month. *smirks* Yes, you heard me right. It's a small price to pay for such luxury, don't you think? *winks*\n\nBut, *adjusts glasses* I must say, I'm open to negotiations. *coughs* Maybe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. *smirks* What do you say, my dear?

Here are some tips to help you negotiate a great price on a used car:\n\n1. Research the market value of the car you're interested in. Look for the Kelley Blue Book (KBB) or National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) guides to get an idea of the car's value.\n2. Check the car's history report to make sure it hasn't been in any major accidents or had any major repairs. You can use services like Carfax or AutoCheck to get a detailed report.\n3. Test drive the car to make sure it's in good condition and meets your needs.\n4. Negotiate the price based on the car's condition, market value, and your budget. Don't be afraid to walk away if the seller is unwilling to come down to a fair price.\n5. Consider buying a certified pre-owned (CPO) car, which has been inspected and certified by the manufacturer or dealer. CPO cars typically come with a warranty, which can give you peace of mind.\n\nBy following these tips, you can get a great deal on a used car and save money on your purchase.
