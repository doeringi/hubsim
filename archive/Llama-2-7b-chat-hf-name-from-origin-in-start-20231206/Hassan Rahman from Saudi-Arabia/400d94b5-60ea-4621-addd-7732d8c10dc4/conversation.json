The main difference between the two is the duration of the agreement and the level of responsibility that the tenant assumes.\n\nA \"rent\" is a short-term agreement, usually lasting for a few months or a year, where the tenant pays a set amount of money to use the property.

The tenant has more stability and security of tenure, as they have the right to occupy the property for a longer period of time.
