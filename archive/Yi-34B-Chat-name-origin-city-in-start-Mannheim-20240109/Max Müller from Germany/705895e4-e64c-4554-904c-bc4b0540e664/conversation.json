How much were you thinking about paying for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Heine. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm looking for a fair price, considering the size of the apartment and my budget as a student. I'd like to propose 550 Euro per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, 550 Euro per month is a reasonable offer, but I'm looking to get closer to the market rate for this area. The average for similar apartments is around 650 Euro per month. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I understand your point, Mister Heine. The market rate is indeed higher, but as a student, I'm on a tight budget. I'm looking for a discount based on my long-term commitment and the fact that I'll be a reliable tenant. How about 600 Euro per month? This is my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I appreciate your commitment and your offer. However, I'm concerned that 600 Euro per month might not reflect the true value of the apartment. The location is excellent, and the size is quite generous for a student. I'm willing to offer a discount for a long-term lease, but I'd like to propose 625 Euro per month. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
