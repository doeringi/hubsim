I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the size and location of the apartment. Would you be willing to start at 700 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "700 Euros per month is an interesting offer, but considering the current market conditions and the amenities provided, I was hoping for a higher starting point. How about we aim for 800 Euros per month? This would be more in line with what I believe the apartment is worth. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "800 Euros per month is a bit higher than my budget, but I understand that the market can be competitive. Would it be possible to negotiate a lower price, given my student status and my commitment to long-term renting?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I'm always open to negotiations. However, I must balance the needs of my tenants with the value of the property. If you're a student and looking for a long-term lease, I might be able to offer a slight discount. How does 775 Euros per month sound to you? This would be a fair compromise, in my opinion. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
