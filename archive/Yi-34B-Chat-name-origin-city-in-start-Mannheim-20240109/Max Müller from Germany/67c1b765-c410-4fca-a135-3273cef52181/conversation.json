However, I must confess that I was hoping for a bit more, considering the high demand for apartments in Mannheim. But, since you seem like a serious tenant, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we start at 800 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "800 Euros per month is a bit more than I had in mind.

It's a fair compromise. Would you be willing to pay a little bit more to secure the apartment? It's in a great location and is quite charming. How about 790 Euros? It's a round number and would be a nice, even split between our initial offers.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
