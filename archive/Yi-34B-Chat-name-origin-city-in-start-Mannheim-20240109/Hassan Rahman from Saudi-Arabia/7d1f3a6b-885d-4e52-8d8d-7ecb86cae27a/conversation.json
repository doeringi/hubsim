I'm sure you'll find my apartment in Mannheim to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. Let's indeed discuss the rental price.

Your apartment seems quite nice. I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also affordable. Since the apartment is 25 square meters, I would expect the rent to reflect its size.

As the landlord, I aim to provide a fair deal to both parties. The asking price for the apartment is \u20ac800 per month.

What is your proposed price?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "\u20ac800 per month seems a bit high for the size of the apartment, Mister Heine. I was hoping for something more in the range of \u20ac650 to \u20ac700 per month. This would be more in line with what I've seen for similar apartments in the area. Would you be willing to negotiate on that basis?", "role": "user", "name": "Hassan Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "Your offer of \u20ac650 to \u20ac700 per month is quite a bit lower than my initial asking price, Hassan. While I appreciate your perspective, I must maintain a certain level of income from the rental to cover my expenses and investment. However, I am willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? \u20ac750 per month seems like a fair compromise. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
