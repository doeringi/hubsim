I'm sure you'll find my apartment in Mannheim to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. Let's discuss the rental price. What would be your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Heine. I appreciate your time and effort. I'm looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also affordable. I'd like to propose a starting price of 650 Euro per month, which I believe is a fair offer considering the size and location of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Nesibe, your offer of 650 Euro per month is a good starting point. However, I must admit that I am looking for a price that reflects the value of the apartment. It's a prime location in Mannheim, and the neighborhood is very safe and quiet. I think a price closer to 750 Euro per month would be more in line with the market value. What are your thoughts on this?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, your point about the location and safety of the neighborhood is well-taken. I understand that these factors contribute to the value of the apartment. However, as a student, I'm on a tight budget, and 750 Euro per month is quite high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to my initial offer, say around 680 Euro per month? This would still be a fair reflection of the market value, in my opinion, and would be more manageable for my financial situation.", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Nesibe, I understand your budget concerns as a student. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet halfway. How about 700 Euro per month? This would be a fair compromise that takes into account both your financial situation and the market value of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
