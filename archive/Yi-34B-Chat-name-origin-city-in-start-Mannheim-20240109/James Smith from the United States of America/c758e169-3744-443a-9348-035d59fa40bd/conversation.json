The market value for such an apartment in this area is around 800 Euros per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate a bit, considering your situation as a student.

This is within my budget and would help me manage my finances effectively. Is this something we can discuss further?", "role": "user", "name": "James Smith from the United States of America"}, {"content": "650 Euros is a significant discount from the market value. While I understand your budget constraints as a student, I must also consider the expenses associated with maintaining the property. Let's find a middle ground that is fair to both of us. How about we start with 750 Euros per month? This is still below the market rate and should be more manageable for you. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
