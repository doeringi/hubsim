As a landlord, I understand that every tenant has different needs and budgets. I'm willing to negotiate a price that is fair for both parties. Let's start with the fact that the apartment is in a prime location, which usually justifies a higher price. However, considering your status as a student, we can certainly discuss a more student-friendly rate.

As a student, I'm looking to keep my expenses low. I would be comfortable with a price that reflects the fact that I'm reliable and will take good care of the apartment.

Indeed, having a tenant who takes care of the apartment is a plus for any landlord. Let's propose a starting price that takes into account your budget as a student and the value of the location.
