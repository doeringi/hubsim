Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Hello Aziz, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. Let's discuss the rental price and find a figure that works for both of us. How much are you considering to pay for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Heine. I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the size of the apartment and the location. Since it's 25 square meters, I think a price around 600 Euro per month would be reasonable. Would you be willing to negotiate on that amount?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "600 Euro per month is an interesting starting point, Aziz. While it's lower than my initial expectation, I'm open to considering it if you're willing to pay a security deposit and cover the utilities. How does that sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "That sounds like a fair offer, Mister Heine. I'm willing to pay a security deposit and cover the utilities. Would you be able to provide me with an estimate of the monthly utility costs so I can factor that into my budget?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Certainly, Aziz. The utilities typically include electricity, water, and heating. On average, I would estimate the monthly utility costs to be around 150 Euro. However, this can vary depending on your usage. Would you like to proceed with the 600 Euro rental price plus the utilities estimate?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
