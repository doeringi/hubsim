I'm looking for a price that reflects the size and location of the apartment. I'd like to pay around 750 Euros per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "750 Euros per month is an interesting offer, Aziz. It's lower than what I was initially considering, but I'm willing to negotiate. Can you justify your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Certainly, Mister Heine. I've been looking at similar apartments in the area, and I believe that 750 Euros per month is a fair market price considering the size and amenities provided. The apartment is quite small, at 25 square meters, and while it's well-maintained, I think this price would be more in line with what I can afford as a student. I'm also very dependable and responsible, and I'm hoping to establish a good relationship with my landlord, which I believe includes fair negotiations.", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Aziz. As a landlord, I'm also interested in finding a tenant who will respect my property and pay a fair rent. 750 Euros per month is indeed a lower offer than I had in mind. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. How about 800 Euros per month? This is a reasonable compromise, I believe. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
