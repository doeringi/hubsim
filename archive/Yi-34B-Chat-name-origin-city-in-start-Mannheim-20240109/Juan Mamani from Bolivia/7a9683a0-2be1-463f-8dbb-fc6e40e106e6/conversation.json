However, I must admit that I was expecting a slightly higher offer, given the current market rates and the desirability of the area. Could you perhaps reconsider your offer and make it a bit more competitive?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Mister Heine. Let's find a middle ground. How about 750 Euros per month? This should be a fair compromise, considering both your expectations and my budget.

It reflects a willingness to meet in the middle. However, I still believe that the apartment's value justifies a slightly higher price. Would you be willing to go up to 775 Euros per month? This would be a more equitable split between our initial proposals.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
