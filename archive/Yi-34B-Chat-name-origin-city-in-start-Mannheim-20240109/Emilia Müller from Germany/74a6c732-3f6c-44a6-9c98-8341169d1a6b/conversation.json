I understand that you're interested in renting my apartment in Mannheim. Let's discuss the rental price to find a mutually agreeable amount. How much are you willing to pay for the 25 square meters?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Heine. I'm looking for a place that's both affordable and suitable for my needs. The location in Mannheim is very appealing to me. Could you tell me what the initial price for the apartment is?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Certainly, Emilia. I initially expected to receive 800 Euros per month for the apartment. However, I'm open to negotiation if you feel that this amount is not within your budget. Please let me know if you have a different price in mind.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "800 Euros per month is quite a bit higher than what I had anticipated. I'm a student, so my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to 750 Euros per month? This would make the apartment more accessible to me.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, as a student, I understand that every euro counts. While 750 Euros per month is a fair offer, I must consider my own financial obligations as a landlord. Could we find a middle ground? Perhaps 775 Euros per month would be more acceptable to both of us? This would still be a discount from the initial price and might be more manageable for you. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
