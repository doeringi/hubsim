As a student, I'm on a tight budget, so I'm hoping to find a price that fits within my financial constraints. Would it be possible to discuss a slightly lower price, say 700 Euros per month? This would still be a fair market rate, considering the size and location of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "700 Euros per month is a bit lower than what I had in mind, but given your budget as a student, I'm willing to consider it. For a 25-square-meter apartment in this location, the price is quite competitive. Would you be willing to pay a security deposit and a small administrative fee? This would help to offset any potential losses in the event of early termination or damages to the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
