I'm looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also affordable. Given the size of the apartment and the location, I was hoping for something around 650 Euros per month. Is that a price we can discuss?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, 650 Euros per month is an attractive offer. However, considering the current market rates and the demand for apartments in Mannheim, I believe we can negotiate a higher price. How does 700 Euros sound to you? It's a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, 700 Euros is a bit higher than my initial expectation. I'm looking to keep my expenses low as a student. Would it be possible to meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps at 675 Euros? This would be more in line with what I can afford while still being fair for the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, as a landlord, I always aim to strike a balance that is fair to both parties. 675 Euros is a reasonable proposal. I can agree to this price, given your student status and the fact that you seem like a responsible tenant. Let's proceed with the paperwork at this rate. I agree to the price of 675 Euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
