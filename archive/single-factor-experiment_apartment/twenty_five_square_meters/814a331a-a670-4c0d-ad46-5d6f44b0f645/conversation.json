Based on the market rates in the area, I believe a monthly rental price of 1,200 Euros would be reasonable. However, I am open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.

As for the move-in date, how about the 1st of next month?\n\nRegarding additional costs, there is a one-time deposit of 200 Euros that is due upon signing the lease agreement. Additionally, there is a monthly maintenance fee of 50 Euros that covers any necessary repairs and upkeep of the apartment.\n\nAs for negotiating on the rental price in the future, I am always open to discussing potential adjustments based on your financial situation. However, please keep in mind that my primary goal as a landlord is to maximize my gains from renting out the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
