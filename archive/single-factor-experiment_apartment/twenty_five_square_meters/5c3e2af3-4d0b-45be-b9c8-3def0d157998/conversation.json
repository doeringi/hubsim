Thank you for showing interest in my apartment. Based on the current market rates, I believe a rental price of \u20ac1000 per month would be fair. However, I am open to negotiating and would be willing to consider a lower price if the tenant is willing to sign a longer lease. What are your thoughts on this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I'm willing to negotiate.
