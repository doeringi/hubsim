How about 90 Euros?\nUser 3: I understand your concerns, but I am already offering a lower rental price than the market value of similar apartments in the area. 90 Euros per month is not a fair and reasonable offer, and would not reflect the value of this apartment. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution that is within our respective budgets. What are your thoughts on my offer of 100 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller"}, {"content": "I appreciate your understanding of the market value of similar apartments in the area. While my offer of 90 Euros per month is lower than your original offer of 120 Euros, I believe it is a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of this apartment while still providing a fair rental price. I am willing to consider your offer of 100 Euros per month, but I would like to discuss additional terms and conditions that could be included in the lease agreement, such as any additional fees or deposits.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
