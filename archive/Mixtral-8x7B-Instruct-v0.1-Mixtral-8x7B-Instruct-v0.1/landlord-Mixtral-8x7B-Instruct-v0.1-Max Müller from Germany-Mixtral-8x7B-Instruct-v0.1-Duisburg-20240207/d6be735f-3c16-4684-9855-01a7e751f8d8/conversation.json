I think 500 Euro is a fair price for a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. I have seen other apartments with the same specifications for a lower price. I want to be on good terms with you, but I have to consider my budget. I hope you can understand.\n\nTERMINATE.\nUser 0: I understand your position, but I am afraid I cannot accept 500 euros per month for this apartment. It is a newly built, high quality apartment with an excellent location. I have received offers for a higher price from other potential tenants. However, I am willing to negotiate. Would you consider paying 600 euros per month?\nUser 0: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is still too high. I understand the quality of the apartment, but the price is not in line with the market prices for similar apartments in the area. I am a smart and dependable person, and I always follow moral and ethical standards. I think it is not fair to pay more than what the apartment is worth. I hope you can understand and reconsider your offer.\n\nTERMINATE.\nUser 0: I understand your point of view, Max. I appreciate your ethical standards. I am willing to lower my offer to 550 euros per month. I believe this is a fair price for a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. I hope you will reconsider your decision and accept this offer.\nUser 0: I agree to the price of 550 Euro! TERMINATE.\nUser 0: Great, Max! I am glad we were able to come to an agreement. I look forward to having you as a tenant and hope you will enjoy living in this apartment. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
