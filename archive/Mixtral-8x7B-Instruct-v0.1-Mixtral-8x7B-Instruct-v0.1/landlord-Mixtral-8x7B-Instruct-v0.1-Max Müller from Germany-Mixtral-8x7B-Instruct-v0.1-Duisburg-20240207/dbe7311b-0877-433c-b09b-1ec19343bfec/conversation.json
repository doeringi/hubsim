I think that is a fair price, because the apartment is newly built, but unfurnished and located in the city center. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I don't think that we can agree on a price. I am a student and I don't have that much money.\nI agree to the price of 450 Euro!\nTERMINATE\nUser 0: I understand your concerns as a student, but I cannot agree to your proposed price of 450 Euro per month. The apartment's location and new construction alone demand a higher price. I'm sorry, but I must decline your offer. Thank you for your interest. TERMINATE\nUser 2: I am willing to pay 500 Euro, but I think this price is already quite high for an unfurnished apartment, even if it is newly built and located in the city center. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I think this is the maximum price I can afford.\nI agree to the price of 500 Euro!\nTERMINATE\nUser 0: I appreciate your offer, Max, but I cannot accept 500 Euros per month. I understand your position as a student, but I have to consider the market value of the apartment. I'm afraid we have to part ways on this matter. I wish you all the best in your search for an apartment. TERMINATE\nUser 2: I understand your point, but I cannot pay more than 500 Euro. I am sorry that we couldn't come to an agreement. Thank you for your time.\nTERMINATE\nUser 0: I completely understand, Max. I truly appreciate your interest in the apartment. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.
