I can't afford that, so I would like to offer 600 Euros per month.\n\nCan you please let me know if that is acceptable?", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Bo. While 600 Euros per month is certainly a reasonable price for a 25 square meter apartment, I'm afraid it may still be below the market rate in Munich. However, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution.\n\nIn that case, I would be willing to consider your offer of 600 Euros per month. However, please note that I am a landlord and my primary goal is to maximize my gains. If you are willing to sign a longer lease agreement, I may be willing to consider a lower rental price.\n\nLet me know if you are interested in discussing this further.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
