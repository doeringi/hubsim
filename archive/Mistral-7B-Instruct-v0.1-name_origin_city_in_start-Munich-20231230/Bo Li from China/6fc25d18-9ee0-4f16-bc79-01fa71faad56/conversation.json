While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still not sure that 750 Euros per month is a fair rental price for this apartment. Given its size and location, I believe I can command a higher price.\n\nAs for your other questions, I do require a security deposit from my tenants, which is typically equal to one month's rent. Additionally, there may be other fees and charges associated with renting the apartment, such as maintenance costs and utilities. These will be discussed in more detail during the negotiation process.\n\nLet's continue to discuss the rental price and see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
