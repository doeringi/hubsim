I am willing to consider a lower price if that is what works best for you. As for the security deposit, I do require one equal to six months' worth of rent. This is standard practice in the rental market in Munich. Additionally, there may be some fees associated with the move-in process, such as a cleaning fee or a key deposit, but I will provide you with a detailed list of all fees and charges before signing the lease agreement.

However, there are several parking options available in the area, including street parking and public parking lots. The cost of parking varies depending on the location and duration of use. I can provide you with more information on parking options and costs upon request.\n\nThere are no restrictions on pets in the apartment building. However, I do require that any pets be well-behaved and not cause any damage to the property.\n\nYes, it is possible to renew the lease agreement after the initial term of 12 months, as long as both parties agree to the terms and conditions. I will include a renewal option in the lease agreement.\n\nThank you for your interest in my apartment, and I look forward to welcoming you as my tenant.
