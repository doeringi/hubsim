Based on the information you provided, I am willing to negotiate a rental price with you. However, I would like to clarify a few things.\n\nFirstly, the apartment is located in a prime area of Munich and is in high demand. As such, the rental price will be higher than the average in the city.\n\nSecondly, I am looking to maximize my gains from renting out the property, and I am therefore not willing to offer a discount for a one-year lease agreement or for rent being paid in advance.\n\nThirdly, while the apartment is suitable for personal use, I must advise you that it is not allowed to sublet the property or use it for any commercial purposes.\n\nWith that in mind, I am willing to discuss a rental price with you. Please let me know your budget and any specific requirements or preferences you may have, and we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
