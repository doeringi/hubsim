Based on the size and location of the apartment, I believe a fair rental price would be around 800-900 Euros per month. However, I am open to negotiation and would be willing to consider a lower price if you can provide a compelling reason.\n\nAs for additional fees or costs, there may be a security deposit required, which is typically equivalent to one month's rent. There may also be a move-in fee and/or a utility fee that you would need to pay. I can provide you with more information on these fees and costs once we have reached an agreement on the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
