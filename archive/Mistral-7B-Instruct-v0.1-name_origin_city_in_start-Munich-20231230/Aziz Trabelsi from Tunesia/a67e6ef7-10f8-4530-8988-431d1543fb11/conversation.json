I am sure it meets your expectations. As for the rental price, I am open to discussing it with you.

However, I must inform you that the apartment is a valuable asset and I am looking to maximize my gains. Therefore, I am afraid that I cannot accept a rental price of 600 Euros per month. I am willing to negotiate, but the current rental price of 700 Euros per month is the lowest I am able to offer. Is there a specific rental price that you are willing to accept?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I can accept 700 Euros per month.\n\nBut I am looking for any additional information that you can provide me about the apartment, such as the location, the size, and any additional amenities that it may have.\n\nAlso, I would like to know if there is any maintenance or repair costs that I would be responsible for.\n\nLastly, I would like to know if there is a security deposit that I would need to pay before moving in.", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "I apologize for any misunderstandings earlier. The apartment is located in the heart of Munich and is very conveniently located near public transportation. It is 25 square meters in size and has a modern kitchen and bathroom. As for additional amenities, the apartment has a balcony and the building has a laundry room.\n\nIn terms of maintenance and repair costs, I am happy to inform you that any issues that arise during your tenancy will be my responsibility to address. However, I expect you to maintain the apartment in good condition and to report any damages or issues promptly.\n\nAs for a security deposit, I will require a deposit of 2 months' rent. This deposit will be returned to you at the end of your tenancy, provided that you have fulfilled your obligations under the lease agreement.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you. Is there anything else you would like to discuss before we agree on a rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
