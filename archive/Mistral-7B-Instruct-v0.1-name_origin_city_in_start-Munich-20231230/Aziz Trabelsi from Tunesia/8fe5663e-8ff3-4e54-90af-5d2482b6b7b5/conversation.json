I understand that you are a student with a limited budget, and I want to be fair to you. However, as a landlord, I need to consider my financial needs as well.\n\nBased on the size and location of the apartment, I believe that a rental price of 600 Euros per month is reasonable. This price is still within your budget, and it also allows me to cover my expenses and maximize my gains.\n\nIn terms of terms and conditions, I am open to discussing a lease agreement that is mutually beneficial. I would like to see a security deposit of one month's rent, and I would also require that you pay the rent on time each month.\n\nI hope that we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.
