I'd be happy to provide you with some more information about the apartment and its surroundings.\n\nThe apartment is located in a popular and vibrant neighborhood in Munich, with plenty of local restaurants, cafes, and shops just a short walk away. The area is also well-connected to the rest of the city, with easy access to public transportation and major attractions.\n\nAs for rules and restrictions, we do have a few that we ask our tenants to follow. You'll need to sign a lease agreement that outlines these rules and restrictions, but some of the key ones include no smoking, no pets, and no loud music after a certain hour. We also require our tenants to pay a security deposit upfront, which will be returned at the end of the lease term, provided the apartment is left in good condition.\n\nIn terms of negotiating the rental price, I'm open to discussing a fair and reasonable offer. However, we do have a minimum rental price of 500 Euros per month, which is based on the location and features of the apartment. If you're looking to negotiate below this price, I'm not sure it's feasible, but I'm always willing to listen to your perspective and see if there's room for compromise.
