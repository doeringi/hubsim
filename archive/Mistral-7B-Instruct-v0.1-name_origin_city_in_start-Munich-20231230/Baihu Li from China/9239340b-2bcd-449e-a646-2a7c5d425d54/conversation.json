As a landlord, I am willing to negotiate on the rental price. Based on your offer of 300 Euros per month, I am willing to accept.\n\nRegarding the lease agreement, I can provide you with a sample agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the rental. The lease agreement will include information on the length of the lease, rental payments, security deposit, and any other important details.\n\nAs for changes to the apartment, I am generally open to reasonable modifications that do not damage the property. However, any changes must be approved in advance and may require additional fees.\n\nThe security deposit for the apartment is 200 Euros. This will be returned to you at the end of the lease term, provided that you have fulfilled your obligations under the lease agreement.\n\nAs for moving in on June 1st, that is possible. However, I will need to confirm with my other tenants and make arrangements for the handover of the apartment.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not have any references or testimonials from previous tenants as I am a new landlord. However, I can provide you with references from other properties that I have managed in the past.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
