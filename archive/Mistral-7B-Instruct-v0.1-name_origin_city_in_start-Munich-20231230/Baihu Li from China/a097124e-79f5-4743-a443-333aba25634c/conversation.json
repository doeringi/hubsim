The apartment is located in a prime location in Munich, and it offers a lot of convenience for renters.\n\nRegarding the rental price, I'm open to discussing it with you.

While I appreciate your interest in the apartment, I'm afraid I cannot accept your offer of 500 euros per month. The market rate for a 25-square-meter apartment in Munich is much higher than that.\n\nI would like to propose a rental price of 700 euros per month, which is fair and reasonable for the size and location of the apartment. What do you think of this proposal?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 700 euros per month.\n\nThank you for your negotiation skills. I am very impressed.\n\nI have no questions about the utilities or anything else. I am just interested in the rental price.\n\nCan you provide me with a contract to sign?\n\nThank you very much for your help.", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Li. I'm glad we could reach an agreement on the rental price. I will prepare a contract for you to sign, and it will include all the necessary details regarding the rental agreement.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns before signing the contract. I'm here to help you in any way I can.\n\nOnce the contract is ready, I will send it to you via email. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.\n\nThank you for choosing to rent the apartment from me, and I look forward to working with you in the future.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
