I am a student, so I want to keep the price as low as possible, but I am also dependable and responsible and I want to be on good terms with my landlord.

I appreciate your willingness to be a responsible tenant and maintain a good relationship with me. However, I am afraid that 600 Euros per month for a 25 square meter apartment in Munich is not a fair price, given the current market conditions. I would be willing to negotiate with you, but I would need to see a higher offer in order to accept it. Is there any room for negotiation on your part?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I understand that the price is high. I am open to negotiating, but I am afraid that I cannot go higher than 600 Euros per month. I would appreciate if you could give me some feedback on my offer. Is there anything else that I can do to make it more acceptable?\n\nTIA!", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your understanding, Emilia. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I understand your constraints as a student. However, I am afraid that 600 Euros per month for a 25 square meter apartment in Munich is still not a fair price, given the current market conditions.\n\nThat being said, I am open to considering your offer if you are willing to provide some additional information or benefits that could make it more attractive. For example, if you are able to sign a longer lease agreement, or if you are able to provide references from previous landlords or employers, this could help to offset some of the risk associated with renting to a student.\n\nI hope this helps, and I look forward to hearing back from you.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
