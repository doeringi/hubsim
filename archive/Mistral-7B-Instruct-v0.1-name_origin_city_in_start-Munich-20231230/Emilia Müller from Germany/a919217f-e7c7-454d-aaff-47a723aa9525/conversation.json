I'm sorry, but I'm not able to provide you with a specific rental price at this time. I would like to discuss the terms and conditions of the lease with you first, such as the length of the lease, the security deposit, and any additional fees that may apply. Once we have reached an agreement on these details, we can then discuss the rental price. Would you be interested in learning more about these terms?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Yes, I am. Can you tell me more about the terms of the lease?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Certainly, Emilia. The lease for this apartment would be a fixed-term lease, with a minimum term of one year and a maximum term of three years. The security deposit would be equivalent to one month's rent, and would be due upon signing of the lease agreement. In addition, there would be a monthly maintenance fee of 10% of the rental price, which would cover any repairs or maintenance that may be necessary during the tenancy.\n\nI would also like to clarify that the rental price is negotiable, and I am open to discussing a price that works for both parties. However, I am looking to maximize my gains as a landlord, so I would appreciate your understanding and flexibility in this regard.\n\nDoes this information help, Emilia?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Yes, it does. Can you give me a rough estimate of the rental price?\n\nAlso, I would like to clarify that I am a student and I have a limited budget. Therefore, I am looking for the lowest possible rental price that meets my needs.\n\nI am open to discussing the terms and conditions of the lease, but I would like to make sure that the rental price is within my budget before we proceed.\n\nThank you for your understanding.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Emilia. Based on the size of the apartment and the current market rates in Munich, I would estimate that the rental price for this property would be around 700-800 Euros per month. However, I am willing to negotiate and consider a lower rental price if it works for both parties.\n\nPlease let me know if this estimate is within your budget, and if so, we can proceed to discuss the terms and conditions of the lease. If not, I am sorry to say that I am unable to accept a rental price lower than this range, as it would not allow me to maximize my gains as a landlord.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
