Based on our research, we believe that the fair rental price for a 25 square meter apartment in Munich is around 1200-1300 Euro per month, depending on the location and the quality of the apartment. However, we are open to discussing a rental price that works for both of us.\n\nRegarding the security deposit, we would require a deposit of 2 months' rent upfront, which would be approximately 260-290 Euro. This deposit would cover any potential damages or unpaid rent during the rental period.\n\nAs for the rental price, we can agree on a price of 1300 Euro per month, which we believe is a fair market rate for a 25 square meter apartment in Munich. This price would be payable in cash on a monthly basis.\n\nIn terms of rent increases or decreases, we do reserve the right to adjust the rental price based on market conditions and the quality of the property. However, we would provide you with at least 30 days' notice if any changes were made to the rental price.\n\nWe can sign a lease agreement before the move-in date of 1st of July 2023, and the move-out date of 31st of July 2023.\n\nDoes that sound like a fair and reasonable agreement to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
