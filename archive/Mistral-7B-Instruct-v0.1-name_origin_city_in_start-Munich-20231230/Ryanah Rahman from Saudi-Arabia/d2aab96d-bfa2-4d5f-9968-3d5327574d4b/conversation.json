Based on the size of the apartment and the current market rates in Munich, I would suggest a rental price of 800 Euros per month. However, I am open to negotiation and would be willing to consider a lower price if it means attracting a suitable tenant. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 800 Euros per month.\n\nThanks for considering my offer.\n\nI want to make sure that I am on good terms with my landlord. Is there anything I should know or do to guarantee that?\n\nAlso, I want to make sure that I am responsible for paying utilities. Can you clarify that?\n\nLastly, I want to make sure that I am able to renew my lease if I want to.

To ensure a good relationship with me, I suggest that you pay the rent on time and maintain the property in good condition. Additionally, I appreciate if you inform me in advance if you plan to make any changes or modifications to the apartment.\n\nRegarding utilities, I would like for you to be responsible for paying them, as it is standard practice in most rental agreements. You can expect to receive a separate bill for utilities, which you will need to pay in addition to the rent.\n\nAs for the lease, I am open to renewing it if you would like to continue renting the apartment. However, I would need to see how well you maintain the property and pay the rent on time. If you are a good tenant, I would be happy to renew your lease.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
