I appreciate your time and consideration.\n\nRegarding the rental price, I would like to propose a monthly rate of 800 Euros. This is based on the size of the apartment and the current market rates in Munich. I believe this price is fair and competitive, considering the location and amenities of the apartment.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about the rental price or the apartment itself?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I would like to negotiate on the rental price. Can you give me some room to negotiate?\n\nAlso, can you tell me more about the amenities of the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Ryanah Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "Of course, I am open to discussing the rental price and would be happy to negotiate within reason.\n\nAs for the amenities of the apartment, it is located in the heart of Munich's city center, with easy access to public transportation, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. The apartment has been fully renovated and features modern appliances, including a dishwasher, microwave, and refrigerator. Additionally, it has a comfortable living area and a cozy bedroom with built-in storage. The apartment also comes with a balcony that offers beautiful views of the city.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or concerns, and we can continue our negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I agree to the rental price of 800 Euros, but I would like to have a discount on the first three months of rent. Is that possible?\n\nAlso, can you give me more information about the lease agreement?\n\nThank you.\n\nAlso, do you have any other apartments available that may be more suitable for my needs?", "role": "user", "name": "Ryanah Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "Thank you for your prompt response, Ryanah.\n\nI am glad to hear that you agree to the rental price of 800 Euros per month. I understand that you would like a discount on the first three months of rent. While I am not able to provide a discount on the full rent, I can offer a discount of 50 Euros per month on the first three months of rent, bringing the total monthly rent to 750 Euros.\n\nRegarding the lease agreement, it would be a standard rental agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the tenancy. It would include details such as the duration of the lease, the payment schedule, and any rules and regulations that apply to the apartment. I am happy to provide you with a copy of the lease agreement once you have agreed to the rental price and any additional terms.\n\nAs for other apartments, I do have a few other properties available that may be more suitable for your needs. I would be happy to show you these options if you are interested. Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like to schedule a viewing.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
