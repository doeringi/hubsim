While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must say that 300 Euro per month is quite low. As a landlord, my goal is to maximize my gains. However, I am open to discussing a fair rental price that benefits both of us.\n\nCould you perhaps consider a rental price of 400 Euro per month? This would still be a reasonable price while also allowing me to maximize my profits. If this is not acceptable to you, then I'm afraid I cannot accept your proposal at this time.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
