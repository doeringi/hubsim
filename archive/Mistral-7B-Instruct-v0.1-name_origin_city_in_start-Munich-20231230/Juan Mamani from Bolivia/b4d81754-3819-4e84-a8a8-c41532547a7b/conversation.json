While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must say that I am very particular about my tenants, and I want to make sure that I get the best possible return on my investment. Based on my calculations, I would need to charge at least 1,000 Euros per month to cover my expenses. However, I am willing to consider your proposal if you can provide evidence of your responsibility and dependability as a tenant. In that case, I might be able to negotiate a slightly lower rental price. Can you provide me with some references or proof of your past rental history?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
