I am glad to hear that you are a responsible and dependable tenant, and I am confident that you will take good care of the apartment.\n\nTo clarify, the rental agreement will be for a minimum of one year, with the option to renew for an additional year. The security deposit for the apartment is 200 Euros, which will be returned to you at the end of the lease term, provided that you have fulfilled your obligations under the rental agreement. There are no additional moving fees, but you will be responsible for paying for your own transportation costs.\n\nIn terms of utilities and other expenses, you should budget for electricity, water, and gas expenses. These costs are typically paid monthly by the tenant and are billed directly by the utility companies. You should also factor in the cost of internet and phone services, as well as any other expenses that you may incur during your stay in Munich.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, and I wish you a successful and enjoyable stay in Munich!\n\nBest regards,\nHeinrich Heine", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
