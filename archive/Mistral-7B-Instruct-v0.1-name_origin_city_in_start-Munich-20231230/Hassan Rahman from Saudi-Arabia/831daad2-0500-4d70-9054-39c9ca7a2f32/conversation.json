I understand that you are interested in renting the apartment, and I am happy to discuss the rental price with you.\n\nThe apartment is 25 square meters and is located in a prime location in Munich. It is a great opportunity for someone looking for a comfortable and affordable living space in the city.\n\nBased on the current market rates, I am sure we can come to an agreement on a rental price that works for both of us. However, I would like to clarify that I am looking for the highest possible rental price for the apartment.\n\nWhat rental price are you willing to offer for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 500 Euro per month. How can I pay the rent?\n\nI am a student and I don't have a stable income, so I am looking for a flexible payment plan. Is it possible to pay the rent in installments or in advance?\n\nI am also concerned about the security deposit. How much is the security deposit, and when is it due?\n\nAdditionally, I would like to know if there are any rules or restrictions on the use of the apartment. For example, can I have pets, smoke inside, or use loud music?\n\nFinally, I would like to know if there is a parking space available for my car. If not, do you have any recommendations for where I can park?", "role": "user", "name": "Hassan Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "Thank you for your interest in the apartment, Hassan. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate on the rental price.\n\nRegarding your payment plan, it is possible to pay the rent in installments. However, I would prefer if you could pay the full amount upfront or in three equal installments throughout the tenancy period. This would help me to better manage my finances and ensure that the apartment is maintained to a high standard.\n\nThe security deposit for the apartment is 2,000 Euros. It is due upon signing the lease agreement.\n\nAs for the rules and restrictions on the use of the apartment, I do not allow pets inside the apartment. Smoking is only allowed outside on the balcony, and loud music should be kept to a minimum to avoid disturbing neighbors.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no parking space available for your car in the apartment complex. However, there are several parking garages and street parking options nearby. I recommend exploring these options to find a suitable parking spot for your car.\n\nIn terms of the rental price, I am willing to accept your offer of 500 Euros per month. However, I would like to clarify that this is the final price and there are no additional fees or charges associated with the rental.\n\nI hope this information has been helpful, Hassan. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 500 Euro per month.
