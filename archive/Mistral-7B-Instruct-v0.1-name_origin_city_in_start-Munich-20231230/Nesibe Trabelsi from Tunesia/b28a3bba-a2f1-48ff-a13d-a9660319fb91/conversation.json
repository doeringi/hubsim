While I understand your interest in the apartment, I am afraid I cannot accept your offer of 500 Euros per month. The market rate for a 25-square meter apartment in Munich is higher than that.

Can we agree on 650 Euros per month?\n\nI am a student, and I am very responsible and dependable. I am sure I can make the payments on time. I also want to be on good terms with my landlord. So I would like to negotiate a lower rental price with you.\n\nI have also heard that you have some furnishings in the apartment. Would you be willing to include those in the rental price?\n\nI would like to make the apartment my home, and I am willing to pay a little more for a comfortable living space. I am also willing to sign a long-term lease to show my commitment to this apartment.\n\nThank you for considering my offer. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nNesibe Trabelsi", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Thank you for your counteroffer, Nesibe. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your interest in the apartment. However, I must inform you that I cannot accept your offer of 650 Euros per month. The market rate for a 25-square meter apartment in Munich is higher than that, and I must ensure that I am getting the best possible rental price for my property.\n\nThat being said, I am willing to consider your request for furnishings to be included in the rental price. However, I would need to discuss the specific items you are interested in and their value before making a final decision.\n\nAdditionally, while I appreciate your willingness to sign a long-term lease, I would need to consider the length of the lease and the corresponding rental price. I would need to carefully evaluate the potential risks and rewards of offering a longer lease.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and I hope we can continue to discuss a rental price that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
