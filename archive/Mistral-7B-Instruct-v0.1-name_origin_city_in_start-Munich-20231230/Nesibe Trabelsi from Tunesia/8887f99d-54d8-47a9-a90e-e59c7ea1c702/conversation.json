I appreciate your interest in renting it.\n\nI understand that you are looking for a fair and reasonable rental price. However, as a landlord, my primary goal is to maximize my gains from renting out the apartment. Therefore, I am willing to negotiate with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nBased on the size and location of the apartment, I am willing to offer a rental price of 800 Euros per month.
