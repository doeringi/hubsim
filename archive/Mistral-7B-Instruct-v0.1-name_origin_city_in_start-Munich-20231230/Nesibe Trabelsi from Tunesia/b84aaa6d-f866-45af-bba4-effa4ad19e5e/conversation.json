In terms of lease terms, I can offer you a one-year lease with the option to renew for another year. The lease will start on the first day of the month following the signing of the lease agreement.\n\nRegarding maintenance and upkeep, I am responsible for maintaining the structure and major systems of the apartment, such as the plumbing, electrical, and heating systems. However, you will be responsible for maintaining the interior of the apartment, including cleaning and repairs. There may be additional costs for maintenance and repairs, depending on the extent of the damage and the cost of repairs.\n\nAs for pets, I regret to inform you that I do not allow pets in the apartment. This is due to the potential for damage to the apartment and the potential for noise disturbances to other tenants.\n\nFinally, there are no additional fees or charges for renting the apartment, other than the monthly rental price of 800 Euros.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, Nesibe. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
