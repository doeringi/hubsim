I understand your concerns, and I am willing to be flexible in order to reach an agreement that works for both of us. In that case, I would be willing to lower my offer to 500 Euro per month, provided that you agree to certain conditions. For example, I would like to require the tenant to sign a long-term lease agreement, which would provide me with a more stable source of income. Additionally, I would require the tenant to pay a security deposit upfront, which would cover any potential damages or unpaid rent. Please let me know if you are willing to accept these conditions, and we can proceed with the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
