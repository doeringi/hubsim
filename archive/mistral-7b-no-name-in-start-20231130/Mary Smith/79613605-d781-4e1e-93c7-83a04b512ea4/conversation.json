I understand that you are trying to maximize your rental income, but our prices are based on the size and location of the apartment, and we cannot adjust the rent any further. My proposal is still the most competitive in the area. If you are interested in a higher rental price, I would be happy to discuss other options with you, such as a longer lease term or additional services that we can offer.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions or if you would like to discuss further.", "role": "user", "name": "Mary Smith"}, {"content": "Thank you for your response.
