Based on your requirements, I would suggest a monthly rental price of \u20ac1050. This is a fair market rate for a 25 square meter apartment in this area, and it should be within your budget.

Our counter-offer would be \u20ac950 per month, which is still within your budget.\n\nThe timeline for the rental agreement would be for a minimum of one year, with an option to renew for another year.\n\nFor the security deposit, we would require two months' rent upfront, which would be \u20ac190.\n\nTo renew the rental agreement or end it early, you would need to give us at least one month's notice.\n\nAs for the rules for using the apartment, we ask that you keep the apartment clean and in good condition, and that you do not make any changes to the apartment without our prior approval. Additionally, we ask that you respect our neighbors and not cause any disturbances. Is there anything else you would like to know or discuss?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi"}]
