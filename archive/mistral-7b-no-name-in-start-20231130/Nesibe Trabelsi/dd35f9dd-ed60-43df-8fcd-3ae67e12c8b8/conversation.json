I understand that you're looking for the lowest possible rental price. We can certainly discuss that. However, before we begin, I'd like to clarify that the apartment is 25 square meters in size. Would that be a suitable size for you?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi"}, {"content": "Yes it is, but I'm afraid that the rental price you're asking for is too high. I'm not sure if it's the best price on the market. Can you tell me what the current market rate is for a 25-square-meter apartment in this area of the city?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Certainly, Nesibe. The current market rate for a 25-square-meter apartment in this area of the city is around \u20ac800 per month. However, I can tell you that my apartment has unique features and is in excellent condition, which makes it worth the price. I'm willing to negotiate with you to find a price that works for both of us. What would be your budget for renting this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi"}, {"content": "My budget is around \u20ac700 per month, unfortunately. Would it be possible to accept this price?\n\nAlso, is there a possibility to rent the apartment without a lease?\n\nThank you very much for your time.\n\nBest regards,\nNesibe Trabelsi", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Nesibe. I can accept the rental price of \u20ac700 per month. However, I would like to clarify that I would require a 12-month lease agreement for this apartment, as it is my preferred option.\n\nRegarding your other question, I can certainly consider renting the apartment without a lease agreement, but it would require additional costs and responsibilities on your part, such as paying for maintenance and repairs yourself. It may not be the most convenient option, but it is certainly possible.\n\nOnce again, thank you for your interest in the apartment, and I look forward to working with you. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\nBest regards,\nMister Heine", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi"}]
