Do you have any other proposals?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Of course, I understand that you would like to negotiate. How about we try 750 Euros per month? This is a fair price, taking into account the size of the apartment and the location. Would you be willing to accept this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li"}, {"content": "I am afraid that this price is still too high. Is there any room for negotiation?\n\nI would like to suggest 600 Euros per month.\n\nIf you can't accept this, I would like to terminate the discussion.\n\nPlease let me know.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Understood, Baihu Li. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I am open to discussing a lower rental price. However, the 600 Euros you have suggested is below the market rate for a 25 square meter apartment in this location. My client is unable to accept this price. Is there any flexibility in your budget that would allow us to come to an agreement on a rental price that is within market standards?", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li"}]
