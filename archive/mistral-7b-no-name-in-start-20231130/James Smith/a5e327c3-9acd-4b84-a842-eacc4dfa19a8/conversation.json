While 800 Euros per month is a significant amount, I'm afraid it may not be feasible for me to agree to that price.

What would you suggest as a fair rental price for this apartment?\n\nPlease keep in mind that I'm a student and I want to rent the apartment for the lowest possible price.\n\nAlso, I want to be on good terms with my landlord, so I would prefer a reasonable rental price that takes into account the location, condition, and other factors that may affect the value of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "James Smith"}, {"content": "I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the location, condition, and other factors that may affect the value of the apartment, I would suggest a rental price of 650 Euros per month.

I believe this price is fair and reasonable for both of us. Is this a price that you could agree to?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
