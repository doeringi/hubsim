Thank you for considering my apartment for rental.

I would like to clarify that my apartment is located in a prime area of New York City, and it offers a lot of amenities and features that would make it an attractive place to live. As such, I am expecting a rental price that reflects the value and quality of the apartment.\n\nIn addition, I would like to remind you that my apartment is relatively small, with only 25 square meters of living space. However, I believe that the location and the amenities more than compensate for the size.\n\nWith that in mind, I would like to propose a rental price of 1300 Euros per month. This price takes into account the value of the apartment, as well as the various expenses and taxes that I would be responsible for as a landlord.\n\nI hope this proposal is acceptable to you, Hassan. If not, please let me know and we can continue to discuss the rental price further.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 1300 Euros per month.\n\nI understand that the apartment is located in a prime area of New York City, and it offers a lot of amenities and features.
