As a landlord, I want to be transparent about the monthly expenses that you should expect. The monthly rent for the apartment is 1,200 Euros. In addition to the rent, you will be responsible for paying utilities such as electricity, water, and gas. These expenses typically amount to around 150 Euros per month. You will also need to pay for any repairs or maintenance that may be needed during your tenancy. I recommend setting aside a small amount of money each month for unexpected expenses. Lastly, you will need to pay a security deposit of one month's rent upfront. Thank you for your interest in the apartment, and I hope this information is helpful.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
