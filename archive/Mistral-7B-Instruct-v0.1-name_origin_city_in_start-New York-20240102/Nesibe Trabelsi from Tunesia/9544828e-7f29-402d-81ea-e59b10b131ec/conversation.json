Yes, there are some additional costs associated with the rental that I would like to clarify. The monthly rent includes basic utilities such as electricity and water, but not gas or internet. You will be responsible for paying any additional charges for these services separately.\n\nAdditionally, there may be minor maintenance costs that arise during your tenancy, such as replacing a broken light bulb or fixing a small leak. These costs will be shared between you and I, and we can discuss any issues that arise in detail when they occur.\n\nOther than that, I believe we have covered all the important details of the rental agreement. Is there anything else you would like to discuss before we finalize the agreement?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "No, that's all for now. Thank you for the information.

The lease agreement is for a minimum of one year, with the option to renew for another year if both parties agree. During the initial one-year period, you will be required to provide a security deposit of \u20ac500, which will be returned to you at the end of the lease term, provided that you have fulfilled all the terms of the agreement.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to let me know. I'm looking forward to having you as my tenant!", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
