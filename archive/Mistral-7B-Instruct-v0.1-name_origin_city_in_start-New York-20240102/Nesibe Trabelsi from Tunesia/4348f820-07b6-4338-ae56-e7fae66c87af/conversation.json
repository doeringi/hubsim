Based on the current market rates in New York, an offer of \u20ac800 per month for a 25 square meter apartment is quite reasonable. While I can't guarantee that the landlord will accept this offer, I can certainly try to help you make a strong case for why this price is fair.\n\nHere are a few points you could consider when making your argument:\n\n* The size and location of the apartment may impact its value. While 25 square meters may seem small, it may still be a desirable size and location for some tenants. Be sure to emphasize any unique features or advantages of the apartment that may make it more valuable.\n* The condition and amenities of the apartment may also be factors in determining its rental value. If the apartment is in good condition and has desirable amenities such as a balcony or parking space, this could justify a higher rental price.\n* Finally, you may want to consider offering a longer lease term in exchange for a lower rental price. Many landlords are willing to offer lower rent to tenants who commit to a longer lease, as this can provide more stability for both parties.\n\nKeep in mind that negotiation is a two-way street, and the landlord may have counteroffers or concerns that you will need to address. However, by presenting a strong case for why \u20ac800 per month is a fair rental price based on current market rates and the specific features of the apartment, you may be able to come to an agreement that works for both parties.\n\nI hope this helps, and best of luck with your negotiations!", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
