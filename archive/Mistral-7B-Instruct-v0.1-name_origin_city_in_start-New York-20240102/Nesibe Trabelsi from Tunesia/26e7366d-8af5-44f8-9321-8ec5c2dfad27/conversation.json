The apartment you are interested in is quite charming and has a lot of potential.

I appreciate your interest in the apartment, and I am willing to discuss other aspects of the apartment to find a mutually beneficial arrangement. However, I must emphasize that the monthly rental price is the primary concern for me at this time.

I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I will take your proposal into consideration, but I must emphasize that the rental price remains my primary concern.\n\nRegarding other tenants in the building, I am afraid I cannot provide you with that information. However, I can assure you that the building is well-maintained and has a good reputation in the neighborhood.\n\nAs for other requirements, I would like to know if you can provide a minimum lease term of six months. Additionally, I would like to see your credit report and references to ensure that you are a responsible tenant.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
