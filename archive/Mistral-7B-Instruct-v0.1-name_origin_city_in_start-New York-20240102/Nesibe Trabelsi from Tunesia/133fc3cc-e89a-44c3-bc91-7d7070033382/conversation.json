I understand that your budget is limited, and I am willing to work with you to find a rental price that fits your needs.\n\nI am open to discussing the possibility of a lower rental price, as well as a longer lease term and a lower security deposit. However, I want to make sure that the rental price I propose is still fair and covers my costs as a landlord.\n\nLet's start by discussing the possibility of a lower rental price. Based on your budget of 1000 Euros per month, I am willing to propose a monthly rent of 900 Euros. This is still a fair rental price that covers my costs, but I understand that it may be a stretch for you.\n\nIn addition to the rental price, I am also open to discussing the possibility of a longer lease term. If you are willing to sign a longer lease, I may be able to offer a lower rental price or a lower security deposit.\n\nFinally, I am open to discussing the possibility of a lower security deposit. However, I want to make sure that the security deposit I propose is still sufficient to cover any damages that may occur during your tenancy.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful, Nesibe. I am open to discussing any other ideas you may have, and I am looking forward to working with you to find a rental solution that works for both of us.\n\nBest regards,\n\nHeinrich", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
