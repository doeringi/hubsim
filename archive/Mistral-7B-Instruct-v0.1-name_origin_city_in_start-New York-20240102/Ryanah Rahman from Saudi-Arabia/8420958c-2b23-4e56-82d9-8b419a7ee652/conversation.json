It's a great location for a student who wants to be close to everything. Additionally, the building has a doorman and a fitness center, which are additional perks for the tenant.\n\nGiven the location and the amenities, I believe a rental price of 1200 Euros per month is reasonable.

Is 1200 Euros per month still too high for you, or would you be willing to pay that amount if I could provide some additional information or benefits?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
