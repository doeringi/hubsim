It looks fair and reasonable. I understand that the rental price is 1000 Euros per month and the lease term is 12 months. The security deposit is 200 Euros, which is refundable at the end of the lease term if the tenant has fulfilled their obligations. The tenant is responsible for paying all utilities, which is a standard practice in most rental agreements. The landlord is responsible for maintaining the apartment, which is also standard practice.
