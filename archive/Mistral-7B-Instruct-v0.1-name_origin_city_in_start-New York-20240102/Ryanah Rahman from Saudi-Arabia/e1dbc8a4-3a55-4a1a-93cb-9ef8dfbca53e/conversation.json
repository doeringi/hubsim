Well, I'm afraid that I cannot offer you the lowest possible price for the apartment. As a landlord, my primary goal is to maximize my gains from renting out the apartment.

Can you give me an idea of what the standard rental price is for a 25 square meter apartment in this area?\n\nAlso, I want to know about the lease term. Is it possible to rent the apartment for a shorter term?\n\nThank you for your time.", "role": "user", "name": "Ryanah Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "Certainly. A 25 square meter apartment in this area typically rents for around \u20ac1,000 to \u20ac1,500 per month, depending on the location and amenities. As for the lease term, I am open to discussing different options, including shorter terms. However, keep in mind that a shorter lease term may come with additional fees and penalties.
