The lease term for the apartment would typically be a minimum of one year, with an option to renew for additional terms.

Generally, the rent would cover the cost of utilities, maintenance, and any other expenses associated with the apartment.\n\nTo ensure that we have a good working relationship, I would recommend being prompt with rent payments, maintaining the apartment in good condition, and being respectful of my privacy and property. I would also appreciate it if you could keep me informed of any changes in your plans or circumstances that may affect the lease agreement.\n\nThank you for your interest in the apartment, Max. I look forward to hearing from you soon.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
