What do you think would be a reasonable rental price for a 25 square meter apartment in New York?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Emilia. I understand that you're looking for the lowest possible price, but I'm afraid that's not something I can accommodate. As a landlord, I want to maximize my gains, and a very low rental price would not allow me to do that. However, I am open to discussing a reasonable rental price that would benefit both of us. Based on my research, I believe a reasonable rental price for a 25 square meter apartment in New York would be around 1500-2000 Euros per month, depending on the location and other factors. Would you be willing to consider a rental price in that range?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I am open to discussing a rental price in that range, but I would like to negotiate. Can you provide me with a specific rental price you have in mind?\n\nAnd also, I want to make sure I am on good terms with the landlord. Is there anything I can do to show my reliability and responsibility?\n\nI am also considering the possibility of moving in with a roommate to split the cost of the rent. If that is an option for you, I am open to discussing it further.\n\nFinally, I would like to know if there are any additional fees or charges that I should be aware of on top of the rental price.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your response, Emilia. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your interest in finding a mutually beneficial solution. I would be happy to discuss a rental price that works for both of us. Based on my research, I believe a rental price of 1750 Euros per month would be a reasonable offer, considering the location and other factors. However, I am open to discussing a higher or lower rental price depending on your needs and circumstances.\n\nRegarding your question about being on good terms with the landlord, I believe that being prompt with your rental payments and maintaining a clean and respectful living environment are key to building a positive relationship. I would also be happy to discuss any additional questions or concerns you may have about the apartment or the rental process.\n\nAs for additional fees or charges, it's important to note that there may be a security deposit required, which is typically equal to one month's rent. Additionally, there may be charges for utilities such as electricity, water, and gas, which would be your responsibility to pay. I would be happy to provide you with more information about these charges and any other fees that may apply.\n\nThank you again for your interest in my apartment, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
