Based on the size of the apartment and the location, I believe that a monthly rental price of 1000 Euros is reasonable. However, I am open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be willing to discuss the possibility of a longer lease term or paying a higher security deposit in exchange for a lower monthly rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Yes, that's a good idea. What would be a good length of lease term?\n\nI would also be willing to pay a higher security deposit if it means a lower monthly rental price. What would be a reasonable amount for a security deposit?\n\nI apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you, but I am on a tight budget as a student and want to make sure I am getting the best deal possible while still being a good tenant.\n\nThank you for your understanding and assistance.\n\nBest regards,\nEmilia M\u00fcller", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your willingness to negotiate. A lease term of 12 months would be reasonable, and in exchange for a longer lease term, we could discuss a lower monthly rental price. As for the security deposit, a reasonable amount would be around two to three months' worth of rent. This would provide adequate coverage for any potential damages or unpaid rent.\n\nI understand your budget constraints as a student, and I appreciate your willingness to be a good tenant. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement that meets both our needs.\n\nBest regards,\nHeinrich Heine", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
