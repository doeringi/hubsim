I am willing to work with you to find a rental price that fits within your budget and meets my needs as a landlord.\n\nBased on the location and condition of the property, I believe that a rental price of 1500 Euro per month is fair. This price takes into account the costs of utilities and other expenses that you will incur as a tenant. Additionally, a deposit of 2 months rent is standard in the New York rental market and would provide me with a level of security.\n\nIf you are willing to agree to these terms, I would be happy to move forward with the rental agreement.
