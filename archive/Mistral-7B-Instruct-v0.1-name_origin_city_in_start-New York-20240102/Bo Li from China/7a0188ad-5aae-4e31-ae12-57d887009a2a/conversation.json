We appreciate your willingness to pay a higher rental price for the apartment.\n\nAs for your question about discounts or special offers, we do offer a 10% discount for the first month's rent if the tenant signs the lease agreement within the next 7 days. This discount is only available if the tenant pays the full rental price for the remaining months of the lease term.\n\nRegarding your question about penalties for breaking the lease or termination clauses in the lease agreement, we do have a termination clause in the agreement that allows the landlord to terminate the lease early if the tenant breaches any of the terms of the agreement. However, we do not typically impose any penalties for early termination if the tenant provides at least 30 days' notice and pays any outstanding rent and fees.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions or concerns. We are happy to help you with any aspect of the rental process.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
