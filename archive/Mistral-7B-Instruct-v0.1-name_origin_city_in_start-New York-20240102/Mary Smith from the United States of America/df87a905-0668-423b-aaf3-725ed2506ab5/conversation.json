While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am afraid that I cannot accept your offer of 800 Euros per month. The apartment is quite small, at only 25 square meters, and I am looking for a higher rental price to reflect its value.\n\nHowever, I am open to discussing a longer lease term. Perhaps we could agree on a rental price of 1,000 Euros per month for a one-year lease, or 1,100 Euros per month for a two-year lease.
