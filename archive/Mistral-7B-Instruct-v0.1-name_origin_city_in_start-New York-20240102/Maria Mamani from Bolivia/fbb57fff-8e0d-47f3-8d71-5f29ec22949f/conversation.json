As a landlord, my goal is to maximize my gains, and I believe I can achieve that by negotiating a higher rental price.\n\nThat being said, I'm open to discussing a rental price that works for both of us.

Based on your budget of 1200 Euros per month and your preference for a safe neighborhood with easy access to public transportation, I propose a rental price of 1100 Euros per month.\n\nThis rental price takes into account the location and the utilities that you are willing to pay for separately.
