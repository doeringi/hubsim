However, I am not willing to accept 850 Euros per month as the rental price. I believe that 800 Euros per month is a fair price for the apartment, given its size and location.\n\nMister Heine: I understand your perspective, Maria. However, I am not willing to accept 800 Euros per month as the rental price either. I believe that the apartment is worth more than that, and I am looking for a higher rental price.\n\nMaria Mamani: I see. In that case, I am willing to increase my proposal to 825 Euros per month. Is that acceptable to you?\n\nMister Heine: Thank you for your revised proposal, Maria. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking for a higher rental price. I believe that the apartment is worth more than 825 Euros per month, and I am willing to discuss a higher price if you are open to it.\n\nMaria Mamani: I understand your position, Mister Heine. However, I am not willing to go above 825 Euros per month as the rental price. If we cannot come to an agreement on a price, I will need to look for another apartment.\n\nMister Heine: I understand your decision, Maria. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate with me. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. I wish you the best of luck in your search for an apartment.\n\nMaria Mamani: Thank you, Mister Heine. I appreciate your understanding and professionalism. I wish you the best of luck in your landlord business.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Maria Mamani from Bolivia"}]
