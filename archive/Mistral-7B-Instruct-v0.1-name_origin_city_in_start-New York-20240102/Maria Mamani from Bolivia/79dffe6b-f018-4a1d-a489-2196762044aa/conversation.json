I am also willing to sign a long-term lease to show my commitment to the property.\n\nI am also aware that utilities are not included in the rental price, but I am willing to pay for them separately. I am just looking for a fair rental price for the apartment.\n\nI hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.
