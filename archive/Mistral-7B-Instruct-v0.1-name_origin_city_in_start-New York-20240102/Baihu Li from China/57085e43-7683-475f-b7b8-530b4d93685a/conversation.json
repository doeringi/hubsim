I look forward to hearing back from you.", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "Of course, Baihu Li. I'd be happy to answer your questions and provide more information about the apartment.\n\nThe apartment is located in the heart of New York City, with easy access to public transportation, shops, restaurants, and other amenities. It features a modern kitchen, a comfortable living room, and a cozy bedroom. The building also has a laundry facility and a rooftop garden for tenants to enjoy.\n\nAs for rules and restrictions, I require all tenants to maintain a clean and respectful living environment, pay rent on time, and follow the building's rules and regulations. I also have a no-pets policy.\n\nIn terms of additional costs or fees, the rental price includes utilities such as electricity, gas, and water. However, tenants are responsible for paying their own internet and phone bills. I also require a security deposit, which will be returned to the tenant at the end of the lease term, provided that they have fulfilled their obligations under the rental agreement.\n\nI hope that answers your questions, Baihu Li. Please let me know if you have any further concerns or if there's anything else I can help you with.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
