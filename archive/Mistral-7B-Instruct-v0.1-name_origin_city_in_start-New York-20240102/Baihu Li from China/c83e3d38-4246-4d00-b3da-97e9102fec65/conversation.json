Can you tell me more about the apartment?\n\nIt has 25 square meters and it is located in the heart of New York City. Is there a parking space available?\n\nI am a student and I want to live in a quiet and peaceful environment. Can you tell me if the apartment is close to any noisy areas or if there are any loud noises that I should be aware of?\n\nIf I want to move in, I need to pay a security deposit of one month's rent.

However, the parking space is not included in the rental price and would need to be negotiated separately.\n\nThe apartment is located in a quiet and peaceful area, but it is also close to many popular attractions and public transportation options in New York City. There may be some noise from the city during peak hours, but overall the area is relatively quiet.\n\nYes, if you decide to move in, you will need to pay a security deposit of one month's rent.\n\nYes, you are welcome to see the apartment before making a decision. Please let me know if you would like to schedule a viewing.\n\nAs for rules and requirements, we do not allow pets and smoking is not permitted in the apartment. Additionally, we have a strict noise policy and ask that tenants be respectful of their neighbors.\n\nI hope this information helps you make an informed decision. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
