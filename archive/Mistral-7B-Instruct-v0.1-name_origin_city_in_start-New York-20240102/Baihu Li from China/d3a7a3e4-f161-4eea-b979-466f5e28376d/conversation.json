Thank you for considering my apartment for your stay in New York. As a landlord, my primary goal is to maximize my gains from the rental. I understand that you are looking for a comfortable and convenient living space, and I am willing to negotiate with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nBased on the size of the apartment, which is 25 square meters, I believe that a rental price of 1,500 Euros per month would be reasonable. This price takes into account the current market rates in New York and the cost of maintaining the property.\n\nOf course, I am open to discussing other terms and conditions, such as the length of the lease and any additional fees that may apply. However, please note that my primary concern is the rental price, and I am not willing to compromise on that.\n\nIf you agree to the rental price of 1,500 Euros per month, I would be happy to proceed with the negotiation and finalize the lease agreement. If you have any other questions or concerns, please feel free to ask.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation.
