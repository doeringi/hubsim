What would you say to a price of 1,500 Euro?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Heinrich, your counter-offer of 1,500 Euro per month is higher than I expected. While the location is excellent, I'm on a student budget, and I'm looking to keep my expenses as low as possible. Could we perhaps meet in the middle? How about 1,350 Euro per month? This would be more in line with my budget and still reflects the value of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I understand that you're on a student budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.
