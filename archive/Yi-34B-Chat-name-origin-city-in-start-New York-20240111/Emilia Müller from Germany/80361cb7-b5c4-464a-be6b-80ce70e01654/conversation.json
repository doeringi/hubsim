I'm looking for a place that's both comfortable and convenient, and your apartment seems to fit those requirements. Regarding the rental price, I'd like to keep it as low as possible.

This is well below the average price for similar apartments in the area.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Your offer of \u20ac1,500 per month is a good starting point.
