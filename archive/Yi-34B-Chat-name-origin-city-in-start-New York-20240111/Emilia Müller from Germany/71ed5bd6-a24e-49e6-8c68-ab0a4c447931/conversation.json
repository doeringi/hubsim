However, given the prime location and the amenities of the apartment, I was hoping for a slightly higher rent. How about we start with 1350 Euros per month?

What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, I appreciate the offer, but I must be honest. My budget is quite strict, and 1350 Euros is a bit higher than I can afford. Could we possibly negotiate a lower price?
