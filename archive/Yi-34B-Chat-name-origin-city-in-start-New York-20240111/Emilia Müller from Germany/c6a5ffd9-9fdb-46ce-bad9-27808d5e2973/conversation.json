[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in New York. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Good afternoon, Emilia. It's a pleasure to meet you. I understand that you're interested in renting the apartment. Let's discuss the price. What is your budget for the rental?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Heine. I'm looking for a place that's affordable, but also comfortable and in a good location. I'm a student, so I need something that won't break my budget. I'd like to start with the price you're asking for the apartment. Is it flexible at all?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your concerns, Emilia. As a student, budget is indeed a crucial factor. The price I'm asking for the apartment is currently 1,500 Euro per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate a lower price if it fits within your budget. Can you tell me what you're comfortable paying?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "1,500 Euro is quite a bit for a student like me. I was hoping for something around 1,200 Euro per month. That would be more in line with what I can afford. Would you be willing to consider that?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, 1,200 Euro per month is a significant reduction from the 1,500 Euro I'm currently asking. I'm not sure if I can accommodate that request. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at 1,350 Euro per month? This is a fair compromise, I believe. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
