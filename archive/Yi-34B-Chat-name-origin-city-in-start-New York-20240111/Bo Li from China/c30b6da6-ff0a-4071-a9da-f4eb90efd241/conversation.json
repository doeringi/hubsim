I'm looking for a price that reflects the value of the property. How about we start negotiations at 2000 Euro per month? This is a fair price for the amenities and the neighborhood. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, your counter-offer is more in line with the market rate. However, as a student, I'm on a tight budget. Can we possibly negotiate a lower price? Perhaps if there are any additional amenities or services you could provide, it could help balance the cost.", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "Bo Li, I understand that as a student, you're looking for the best deal. However, the price I'm offering is already quite competitive for the area. The apartment is fully furnished and equipped with all the necessary utilities, so there's not much wiggle room in terms of additional amenities. Are you willing to meet in the middle at 1800 Euro per month? This would be a fair compromise, considering your budget and the value of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
