[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Bo Li from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in New York.

Let's indeed discuss the rental price. How much are you considering to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Heine. The apartment seems very nice, and I think it would be a good place for me to live. As for the rental price, I'm looking to pay around $1,200 per month. Is that something that could be negotiated?", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "Bo Li, $1,200 per month is an interesting offer. While it may not be the highest price I could potentially get, it's certainly a fair amount. Given the size of the apartment and its location, I think $1,200 could be a starting point for our negotiation. Would you be willing to discuss a slightly higher price? Perhaps $1,250?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my offer, Mr. Heine. $1,250 is a bit higher than I had in mind, but I understand that it's a fair price considering the apartment's condition and location. I would be willing to discuss a price closer to my initial offer, say $1,225. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "Bo Li, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. $1,225 is a price I could consider, especially since you seem like a respectful and reasonable tenant. Would you be willing to pay a bit more, say $1,235, to secure the apartment? This would help cover some of the maintenance costs I incur as a landlord.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
