Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Bo Li. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. Let's discuss the rental price. What amount were you considering?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Heine. I'm looking for a place that is both affordable and suitable for my needs. Since the apartment is 25 square meters, I was hoping for a price that reflects its size. Would you be willing to offer a lower rate considering the size of the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Bo Li. The size of the apartment is certainly a factor in the rental price. However, I must consider my expenses as a landlord and the current market rates. Would you have a specific price in mind that you feel would be fair?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "As a student, I'm looking to save as much as possible on living expenses. I was hoping for a price around $1,000 per month. This would be very manageable for me and would help me keep my expenses low. Is this something you could consider?", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "Bo Li, your budget of $1,000 per month is quite reasonable, especially for a student. While I appreciate your situation, I must be fair to both parties. The market rate for similar apartments in the area is around $1,200 per month. However, considering your budget and the fact that you are a student, I'm willing to negotiate. How does $1,100 per month sound to you? This would be a fair compromise and still within your budget. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
