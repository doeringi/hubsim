It's a nice space, and I believe it could be a good fit for me. Regarding the price, I'm looking to keep my expenses low as a student.

While 1500 Euros is a reasonable request, I must be honest with you. The location of the apartment and its amenities do command a higher price. However, since you're a student, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we start at 1800 Euros? This is a fair price considering the market value of similar apartments in the area. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Mr. Heine. 1800 Euros is a bit higher than what I had in mind, but I understand that the location and amenities are important.
