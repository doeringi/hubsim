I'm sure you'll find this apartment quite comfortable during your stay in New York. Now, let's discuss the rental price. I'm looking to get the best rate possible, as I'm sure you are.

While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, 1200 Euros per month is below my expectations for this apartment. Can you perhaps increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I understand that, and I'm willing to discuss a higher price. How about 1250 Euros per month? I believe this is a fair offer considering the market value and the amenities provided.", "role": "user", "name": "James Smith from the United States of America"}, {"content": "Your offer of 1250 Euros per month is more in line with my expectations, but I'd still like to get a bit more for the apartment.
