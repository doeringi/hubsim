However, considering the current market and the demand for apartments in New York, I'm looking for a higher price. How about 1,800 Euro per month?

What is your response to this counter-offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you for your counter-offer, Mr. Heine. Your proposal of 1,800 Euro per month is higher than what I had in mind. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to find a price that is fair for both parties. How about we meet in the middle at 1,650 Euro per month? This seems like a reasonable compromise. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "James Smith from the United States of America"}, {"content": "Your suggestion of 1,650 Euro per month is an interesting point. It does represent a middle ground between our positions. However, given the current demand and the amenities provided, I'm confident that the apartment can fetch a higher price. How about we settle at 1,750 Euro per month? This would be a fair reflection of the market value and would still be a considerable gain for you, given your initial offer. What is your response to this new offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
