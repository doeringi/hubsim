[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Mary Smith from the United States of America. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in New York.

Please make an offer, and we can discuss the details.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Well, considering the size of the apartment and the location in New York, I think a fair price would be around 2000 Euro per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Mary Smith from the United States of America"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 2000 Euro per month is too low for this prime location in New York. I'm looking for a price closer to 3000 Euro per month. What can you offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "3000 Euro per month is quite steep, especially considering the current market and the size of the apartment. I'm sure we can find a more reasonable middle ground. How about 2500 Euro per month? That's a good compromise, I think.", "role": "user", "name": "Mary Smith from the United States of America"}, {"content": "2500 Euro per month is more in line with what I had in mind. If you're willing to pay a deposit equivalent to one month's rent, we can agree on a two-year lease with this price. Would you be interested in such a deal?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
