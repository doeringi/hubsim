I am open to discussing a fair price for the apartment.

Since it's a modest space in a great location, I would be willing to pay a premium. However, I'm also on a student budget, so I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be open to negotiating a lower rate, considering my situation?", "role": "user", "name": "Mary Smith from the United States of America"}, {"content": "Certainly, Mary.

Would you be willing to accept this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Mary Smith from the United States of America"}, {"content": "$1,500 per month is a very generous offer, Mary.
