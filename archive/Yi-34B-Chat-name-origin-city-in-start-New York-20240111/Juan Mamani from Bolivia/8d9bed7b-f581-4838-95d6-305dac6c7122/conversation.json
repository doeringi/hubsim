Would you like to make a counter-offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "2,000 Euro per month is a bit high for my budget as a student.

Would you be willing to pay a slightly higher amount, say 1,900 Euro per month, to ensure that the apartment meets your expectations in terms of comfort and location?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
