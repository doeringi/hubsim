I'm sure you'll find the apartment quite charming. Let's discuss the rental price. What would you consider a fair price for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Heine. The apartment is indeed very nice. I'm looking for a place that's both affordable and comfortable. Since the apartment is 25 square meters, I think a fair price would be around 800 Euro per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Aziz. While I appreciate your perspective, I must admit that 800 Euro per month is lower than my expectations for this prime location. I'm looking to rent it out for a price that reflects the value of the property and the neighborhood it's in. Would you be open to considering a higher offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I understand that the location is prime, Mister Heine. However, as a student, I'm on a tight budget. I'm looking for a place that I can afford while still being in a good area. Would you be willing to negotiate a bit more on the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "I'm always open to negotiation, Aziz. How about we meet halfway? I'll offer you the apartment for 1000 Euro per month, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the quality of the apartment and the area it's in.
