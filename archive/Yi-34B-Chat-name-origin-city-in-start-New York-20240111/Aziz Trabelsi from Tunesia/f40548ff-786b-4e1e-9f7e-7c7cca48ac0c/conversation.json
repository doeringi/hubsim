As the landlord, I aim to achieve a fair market price that reflects the value of the apartment. Considering the size and location, I would start the negotiations at $1,500 per month. What do you think about this initial offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "$1,500 per month is quite a bit higher than what I had in mind, given the size of the apartment.
