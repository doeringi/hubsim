Is this a price that could work for you?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Nesibe, your offer of 1,200 Euro per month is quite generous, but considering the size of the apartment and its location in New York, I was hoping for a price that reflects its true value. How about we start with a price that's a bit closer to what the market suggests, say, 1,500 Euro per month? This would be more in line with what I believe the apartment is worth. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, your suggestion of 1,500 Euro per month is higher than what I had in mind.

Would you be willing to consider my offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Nesibe, I appreciate your perspective. While 1,200 Euro may be within your budget, I have to consider the overall value of the apartment. The location in New York does come with certain costs, and I believe a price closer to 1,500 Euro per month would better reflect the market value. However, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at 1,350 Euro per month? This would be a fair compromise, in my opinion. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
