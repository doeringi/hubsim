I am sure you will find it a comfortable and convenient place to live. Let's discuss the price that would make both of us happy.

I'm looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also affordable. Considering the size of the apartment and the location, I was thinking of starting around 1200 Euro per month. Would this be a fair price for both parties?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Ms. Trabelsi. While 1200 Euro is a reasonable starting point, I believe we can negotiate a price that reflects the true value of the apartment. The location, in particular, is quite desirable, and the amenities in the building are top-notch. I am willing to listen to a counter-offer that takes these factors into account. How does 1500 Euro per month sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, your counter-offer of 1500 Euro per month is quite high for me, considering the size of the apartment. I appreciate the amenities and the location, but I'm on a tight budget as a student. Would you be willing to lower the price to 1300 Euro per month? This would be more in line with what I can afford.", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "As a student, I understand that budget is a significant consideration. However, the 1500 Euro per month reflects the current market value for apartments of this size and quality in this area. I am willing to work with you, but I cannot go as low as 1300 Euro per month. How about we find a middle ground? 1400 Euro per month would be a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
