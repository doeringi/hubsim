[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in New York. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Hello, Nesibe. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find the apartment quite comfortable. Let's discuss the rental price. What amount were you considering?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Heine. I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also affordable. I've been looking at similar apartments in the area, and a price around 1,200 Euro per month would be ideal for me. Would that be a fair starting point for our negotiation?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Nesibe, your offer of 1,200 Euro per month is quite reasonable. However, considering the size of the apartment and its location in New York, I think we can find a price that reflects its value. How does 1,500 Euro sound to you? It's a fair market rate for the area.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my offer, Mr. Heine. 1,500 Euro per month is a bit higher than what I had in mind. I'm on a student budget, and that amount would be quite a stretch. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps around 1,350 Euro? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would be more manageable for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Nesibe, I understand that you're on a student budget. Let's find a balance that works for both of us. How about this: If you agree to a 1,400 Euro per month rent, I'll include all utilities in the price. This would save you the hassle of managing separate bills. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
