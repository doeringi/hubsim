I'm looking for a price that reflects the size of the apartment and the neighborhood. Since it's 25 square meters, I would like to propose a price of 1200 Euro per month.

However, I must consider the current market rates and the potential for higher earnings. Let's negotiate a bit further to find a price that is mutually beneficial. How about we start with 1300 Euro per month? This would be a fair reflection of the apartment's value.
