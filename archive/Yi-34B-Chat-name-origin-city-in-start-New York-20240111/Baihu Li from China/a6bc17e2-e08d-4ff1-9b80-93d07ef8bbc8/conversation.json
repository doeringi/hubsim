[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Baihu Li from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in New York. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Mr. Li. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. Let's indeed discuss the rental price. How much are you willing to pay for the 25-square-meter apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I'm looking for a fair price, Mr. Heine. Considering the size and location of the apartment, I'm prepared to offer 1,200 Euro per month. Is this a price that you would consider?", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "1,200 Euro per month is an interesting offer, Mr. Li. It's a good starting point for our negotiation. However, I believe the apartment's value could be higher, given the demand in the area. Would you be willing to discuss a price closer to 1,500 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "1,500 Euro per month is quite high, Mr. Heine. While I appreciate the quality of the apartment, I'm not sure I can afford that price. Could we perhaps meet in the middle? I'm willing to pay 1,350 Euro per month, which is a fair compromise, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "Hmm, 1,350 Euro per month is better, but still not quite what I'm looking for. How about this: If you're willing to pay 1,400 Euro per month, I'll include all utilities in the price. No extra charges for electricity, water, or internet. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
