However, given the current market trends and the demand for apartments in New York, I was hoping for a slightly higher price. How about we negotiate a bit? Would you be willing to go up to 1,300 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, 1,300 Euro per month is quite a jump from my initial offer. I appreciate the quality of the apartment, but as a student, I need to balance the cost with my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at 1,250 Euro per month? This would be a more manageable expense for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Hassan Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "I understand your budget concerns, Hassan.
