As for additional costs, utilities such as electricity, water, and gas are typically not included in the rental price and must be paid separately by the tenant. Maintenance fees may also be required, depending on the condition of the apartment and the level of service provided by the landlord.\n\nRegarding the possibility of a discount for a longer-term lease, it is possible that the landlord may offer a lower rental price if you sign a lease for a longer period of time, such as one or two years. However, this would depend on the landlord's specific policies and the current market conditions. I would recommend discussing your specific needs and budget with the landlord to see if there are any opportunities for negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
