I would be happy to discuss the rental price with you. Based on market research, I believe that a monthly rental price of 1000 Euros is fair for this 25 square meter apartment. What is your budget for rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I can afford up to 800 Euros, but I would like to negotiate with you to get the best possible deal. Can you offer a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Hassan Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "I understand that you are looking for a lower rental price, Hassan. However, I am afraid that I cannot lower the price below 1000 Euros, as it would not be profitable for me as a landlord. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

I appreciate your interest in the apartment and your commitment to being a responsible tenant. Based on your proposal, I am willing to offer you a discount of 50 Euros per month for the entire length of your lease agreement. This brings the monthly rental price down to 950 Euros.\n\nIn addition, I am willing to accept a security deposit of three months' rent upfront, which would be 2850 Euros. This is a reasonable amount to cover any potential damages or maintenance costs during your tenancy.\n\nAs for any other requirements or conditions, I would simply like to remind you that smoking and having pets are not allowed in the apartment. I also expect you to keep the apartment clean and well-maintained throughout your tenancy.\n\nI am happy to agree to the final price of 950 Euros per month and sign the lease agreement as soon as possible.
