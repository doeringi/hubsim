I'm sure it will be a great fit for you. The apartment is a spacious 25 square meters, and it's located in a prime area of the city. As a landlord, I'm looking to maximize my gains, so I'm open to discussing a rental price that works for both of us.

Can I make the payment in cash?\n\nI'm not very familiar with the payment process in your country.\n\nI want to make sure I pay the rent on time every month.\n\nWhat kind of payment method do you accept?\n\nThank you for your help.\n\nSincerely, Hassan Rahman.", "role": "user", "name": "Hassan Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "Of course, Hassan. I understand that you may be unfamiliar with the payment process in my country. I accept both cash and bank transfers as payment methods for the rental price. If you prefer to pay in cash, you can do so by delivering the payment to me in person at my property office during business hours. Alternatively, you can pay the rental price through bank transfer to my specified account. I recommend using bank transfer as it is a more secure and convenient method of payment.
