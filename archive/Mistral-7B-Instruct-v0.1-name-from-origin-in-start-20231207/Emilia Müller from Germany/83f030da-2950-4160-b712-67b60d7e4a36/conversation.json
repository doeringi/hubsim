Thank you for showing interest in my apartment. I'm afraid I cannot accept your offer, as it is not within my financial means to rent out the apartment for such a low price. I am looking for a higher rental price that will maximize my profits. Would you be willing to negotiate with me and offer a higher price?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I understand that you are looking for a higher rental price. Can you tell me what you are looking for specifically?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Certainly, Emilia. I am looking for a rental price of at least 1,200 Euros per month. This is a fair price considering the size and location of the apartment, as well as the current market rates in the area. I believe this price is reasonable and achievable. Would you be willing to consider this rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I apologize, but I cannot offer you 1,200 Euros per month. That is too high for me. I am willing to negotiate, but I cannot accept that price. Can you offer a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Emilia. However, I cannot lower the rental price any further. The 1,200 Euros per month that I am asking for is a fair and reasonable price based on the market rates and the size and location of the apartment. If you are unable to accept this price, I will have to consider other potential tenants who are willing to pay the market rate. Thank you for your understanding.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
