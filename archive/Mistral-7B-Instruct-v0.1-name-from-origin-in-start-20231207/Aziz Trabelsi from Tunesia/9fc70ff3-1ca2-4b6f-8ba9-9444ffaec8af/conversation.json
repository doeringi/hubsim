If you can provide me with this information, we can continue the negotiation and work towards finding a rental price that is mutually beneficial.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and I look forward to hearing back from you with the required financial information.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I apologize for my low proposal.\n\nI understand that I need to provide financial information to prove my ability to pay the rental price.\n\nI will provide you with my financial information as soon as possible.\n\nThank you for your time and consideration.\n\nPlease let me know if there is anything else I need to do to complete the negotiation process.\n\nThank you.", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Thank you for understanding, Aziz.
