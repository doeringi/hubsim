The monthly rental price is \u20ac800. Is that acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I want to negotiate the rental price. Can you lower it?\n\nI understand that the apartment is 25 square meters, but I am a student and I need to save money. Can you give me a discount?\n\nI also want to be on good terms with my landlord. Can you consider my request?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Thank you for your interest in the apartment, Aziz. I understand your situation as a student, and I'm willing to consider a discount on the rental price. However, I need to keep in mind that I am a landlord and I want to maximize my gains.\n\nBased on the size of the apartment and the market rates in the area, I'm willing to negotiate a discount of \u20ac50 per month. So the final rental price would be \u20ac750 per month.\n\nI believe this is a fair compromise that will allow me to achieve my financial goals while also considering your needs as a student. Is this acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of \u20ac750 per month. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.\n\nCan you provide me with a lease agreement and the details of the apartment?\n\nI also want to know the move-in date.\n\nThank you.", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Of course, Aziz. I'm glad you agreed to the rental price. I'll prepare the lease agreement for you and send it over to your email. The move-in date for the apartment is the 1st of next month.\n\nIf you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm happy to help.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
