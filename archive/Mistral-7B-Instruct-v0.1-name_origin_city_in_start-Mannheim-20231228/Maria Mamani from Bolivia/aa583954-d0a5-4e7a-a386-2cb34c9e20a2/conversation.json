I understand that you are interested in renting it, but I must clarify that the apartment is a bit smaller than what you might be used to in Bolivia. It measures only 25 square meters, but I believe it is a great location, right in the heart of Mannheim.\n\nNow, regarding the rental price, I'm open to discussing it with you. However, I am a landlord and I want to ensure that I get the best possible price for my property. I would like to discuss the rental price in euros, but I will need to see your budget to determine the exact amount.\n\nIf we can reach an agreement on the rental price, I am open to discussing the terms and conditions of the lease. However, please note that I am not willing to negotiate on any other aspects of the lease, such as utilities or anything else.\n\nLet's continue the discussion and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of x Euro, but I need to see the lease agreement first.\n\nI understand that the apartment is smaller than what I might be used to in Bolivia, but I believe it's a great location.
