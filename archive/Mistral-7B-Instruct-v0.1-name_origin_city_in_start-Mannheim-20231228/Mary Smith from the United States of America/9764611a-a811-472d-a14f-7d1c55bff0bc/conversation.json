What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 800 Euros.\n\nI want to make sure that I am paying for utilities as well. Can you give me an estimate of the additional costs I should expect?\n\nI also want to make sure that I am on good terms with the landlord.

The additional costs for utilities will depend on your usage and the specific services you require. You can expect to pay approximately 100-150 Euros per month for electricity, gas, water, and internet.\n\nIn terms of lease terms and regulations, you will need to sign a standard lease agreement that outlines the terms and conditions of the rental agreement. This will include details such as the length of the lease, the security deposit, and any penalties for breaking the lease early.\n\nAs for maintenance and repairs, the landlord is responsible for maintaining the structure and major systems of the apartment, such as the plumbing and electrical systems. However, you are responsible for maintaining the interior of the apartment, including cleaning and repairing any damage caused by your use of the apartment.\n\nIn case of any issues or repairs, you should notify the landlord as soon as possible. The landlord will then arrange for any necessary repairs or maintenance work to be done. If you need to make any repairs or replacements on your own, you should obtain the landlord's approval and receipts for any expenses incurred.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
