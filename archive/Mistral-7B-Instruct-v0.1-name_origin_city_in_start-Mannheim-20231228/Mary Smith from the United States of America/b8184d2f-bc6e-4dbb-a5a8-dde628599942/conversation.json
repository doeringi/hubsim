In that case, I would like to propose a rental price of 300 Euros per month, which is within your budget and still reflects the value of the apartment.\n\nAs for discounts or special promotions for students, I'm afraid I don't have any information on that at the moment. However, I would be happy to discuss any potential concessions or discounts that we could offer to make the rental price more affordable for you.\n\nIn terms of rules and guidelines for living in the apartment, I would like to remind you that you will be responsible for maintaining the property in good condition and paying any additional charges, such as utility bills, that may be incurred during your tenancy. I would also appreciate it if you could keep noise levels to a minimum and avoid any illegal activities on the premises.\n\nOverall, I believe that we can come to an agreement that works for both of us, and I look forward to hearing back from you.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
