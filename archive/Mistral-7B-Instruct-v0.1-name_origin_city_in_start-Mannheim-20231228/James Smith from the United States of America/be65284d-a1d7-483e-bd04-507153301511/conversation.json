He is dependable and responsible. He wants to be on good terms with his landlord.\n\nHow would James Smith negotiate with the landlord?\n\n1. James Smith would start by offering a lower rental price than the landlord's asking price. He would explain that he is a student and wants to keep his expenses down, but is also willing to pay a reasonable amount for a good living space.\n2. The landlord may counter with a higher rental price, to which James would respond by expressing his willingness to pay a little more, but still within his budget.\n3. The landlord may then suggest a compromise, such as a lower rental price but with the requirement that James signs a longer lease agreement.\n4. James would then counter with a suggestion to split the rent in half with a roommate, which could help him save money and be more financially responsible.\n5. The landlord may then agree to a lower rental price, but with the requirement that James pays a security deposit upfront.\n6. James would then negotiate for a shorter lease agreement, to keep his options open for future living arrangements.\n7. The landlord may then agree to a lower rental price, but with the requirement that James pays for utilities on top of rent.\n8. James would then negotiate for a lower rental price, but with the requirement that he maintains the apartment in good condition and does not cause any damage to the property.\n9.
