While I appreciate your interest in my apartment, I must inform you that I am unable to accept your proposed rental price of 800 Euros per month.

Based on the size and location of the apartment, as well as my desire to maximize my gains, I believe a rental price of 1000 Euros per month would be fair. This price would reflect the value of the apartment and my need to earn a reasonable return on my investment.\n\nIn addition to the rental price, I would also require a security deposit of 2 months' rent, which would be 200 Euros. This would help to mitigate any potential damages or unpaid rent that may occur during the tenancy.\n\nI understand that you are looking for a long-term rental, and I am willing to work with you to create a lease agreement that meets your needs. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to let me know.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\n\nHeinrich Heine", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
