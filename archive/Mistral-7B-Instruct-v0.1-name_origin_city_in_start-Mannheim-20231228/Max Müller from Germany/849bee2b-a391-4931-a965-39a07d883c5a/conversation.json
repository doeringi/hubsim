While 400 Euros per month is certainly a fair price, I'm afraid it may not be enough to cover my expenses as the landlord. I would need to see a higher rental price in order to agree to the terms.\n\nIn addition to the monthly rental price, there may be additional fees and expenses that you need to be aware of, such as utilities and maintenance costs. I'll make sure to provide you with a detailed breakdown of these costs before we finalize the rental agreement.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and I look forward to working with you to find a rental price that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
