I understand that you are looking for an affordable rental option and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.\n\nI must admit that 400 Euros per month is a bit lower than I was expecting for this apartment, given its location and size. However, I am willing to be flexible and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nI would like to propose a rental price of 420 Euros per month for this apartment. This price takes into account the location and the size of the apartment, as well as the cost of utilities and other expenses that you will incur as a tenant. I believe that this rental price is fair and reasonable, given the market conditions in Mannheim.\n\nI hope that you will consider my proposal, Max.
