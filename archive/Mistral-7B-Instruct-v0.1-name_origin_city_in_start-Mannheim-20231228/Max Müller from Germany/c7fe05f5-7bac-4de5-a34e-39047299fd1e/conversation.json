However, I'm afraid I have other expenses to consider, such as taxes and maintenance costs. Would it be possible to negotiate a slightly higher rental price, say \u20ac850 per month?\n\nMax M\u00fcller: I understand your concerns, Mister Heine. However, I'm afraid I can't go any higher than \u20ac800 per month. That's my maximum offer.\n\nMister Heine: I see. Well, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Max.
