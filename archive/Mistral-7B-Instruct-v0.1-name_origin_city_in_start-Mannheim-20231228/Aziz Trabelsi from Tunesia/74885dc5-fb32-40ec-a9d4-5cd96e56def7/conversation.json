The apartment you're interested in renting is located in the heart of Mannheim and offers 25 square meters of living space. I understand that you're looking for a fair and reasonable rental price, but I'm afraid I have to be quite firm on this matter.\n\nAs a landlord, my goal is to maximize my gains from renting out this apartment. I believe that the current rental price I'm asking for is fair and competitive, taking into account the location and size of the apartment. However, if you're willing to negotiate, I'm open to discussing the rental price further.\n\nWould you like to make an offer or do you have any questions about the apartment or the rental process?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Yes, I want to make an offer. Can I ask if there is a minimum rental period?\n\nAlso, would you be willing to provide me with some details about the apartment such as its location, number of rooms and bathrooms?\n\nLastly, do you have any references or testimonials from previous tenants that I can contact?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Certainly, Aziz. I appreciate your interest in the apartment and I'm happy to provide you with more information.\n\nRegarding the rental period, I do require a minimum of six months.

The apartment has one bedroom and one bathroom, and is fully furnished with modern appliances and fixtures.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not have any references or testimonials from previous tenants available at this time.
