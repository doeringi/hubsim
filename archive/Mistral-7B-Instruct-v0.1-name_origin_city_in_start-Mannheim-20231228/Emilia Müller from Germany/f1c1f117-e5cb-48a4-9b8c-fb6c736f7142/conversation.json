While 500 Euros per month is still quite low for a 25 square meter apartment in Mannheim, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am open to discussing possible ways to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nOne possibility could be for you to sign a longer lease agreement in exchange for a lower price. This would provide me with more stability in terms of rental income, which could be beneficial for me as a landlord. Additionally, I am open to the idea of you paying a security deposit in advance to show that you are a responsible tenant.\n\nWith that being said, I would like to propose a rental price of 700 Euros per month. This price takes into account the market value of similar apartments in Mannheim, as well as the fact that you are a student who will be living in the apartment for an extended period of time. I believe that this price is fair and reasonable, and I hope that we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.\n\nWhat do you think about this proposal, Emilia?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
