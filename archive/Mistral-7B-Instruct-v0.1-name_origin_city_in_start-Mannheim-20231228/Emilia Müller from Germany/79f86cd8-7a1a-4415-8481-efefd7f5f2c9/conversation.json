I understand that you are interested in renting my apartment in Mannheim. Let's discuss the rental price. Based on the size of the apartment and the current market rates in the area, I believe that a monthly rental price of 800 Euros would be reasonable. However, I am open to negotiation.

While I appreciate your offer, I must respectfully decline. Based on the size of the apartment and the current market rates in the area, I believe that a rental price of 700 Euros per month is lower than what the apartment is worth. However, I am open to negotiating further. What is your counter-offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I propose a rental price of 650 Euros per month.

Can you please provide me with the details?\n\nEdit: I accept the rental price of 650 Euros per month.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your counter-offer, Emilia. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline. Based on the size of the apartment and the current market rates in the area, I believe that a rental price of 650 Euros per month is still lower than what the apartment is worth. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I must stick to my original proposal of 800 Euros per month.\n\nRegarding the deposit, I would require a deposit of one month's rent in advance. This would ensure that the tenant is committed to the rental agreement and would help cover any potential damages or unpaid rent.\n\nThank you for your understanding, and I wish you the best of luck in your search for an apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
