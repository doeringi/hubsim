I'm sure it's a great opportunity for you. As we discussed, the apartment is 25 square meters in size. The rental price that I'm looking for is 800 Euros per month. Is that a price that you would be comfortable paying?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I would prefer a lower price. I would like to negotiate. Thank you for your proposal.

However, I would need to consider my options before accepting a lower rental price. Can you provide more details about your budget and the length of your lease? With this information, I can make a more informed decision.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I can provide you with a budget of 800 Euros per month, but I would prefer a shorter lease term.

I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I will consider your offer. However, I would need to see if I can find another tenant who is willing to pay the original rental price of 800 Euros per month for a 12-month lease. If I am unable to find another tenant, I may be willing to accept your offer of 700 Euros per month for a 6-month lease. However, this is subject to my review and final decision. Thank you again for your interest in my apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
