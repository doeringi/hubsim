I'm sure it will be a great fit for you. In terms of the rental price, I'm looking for something that will help me maximize my gains as a landlord.

I am willing to negotiate to achieve this goal.\nHi Mister Heine, I understand that you are looking for a high rental price. However, I am willing to negotiate and compromise to achieve the lowest possible rental price for this apartment. How about we agree on a rental price of 500 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Bo. While I understand that you are looking for the lowest possible rental price, I'm afraid I cannot accept that offer.

While 700 Euros per month is still a bit lower than what I was looking for, I will consider it as a possibility. I would like to clarify a few points before we agree on a rental price. Firstly, are there any additional costs or fees that I should be aware of, such as utilities or maintenance costs? Additionally, how long would you be interested in renting the apartment for?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
