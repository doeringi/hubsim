Based on the information you've provided, I believe that a rental price of x Euros per month would be reasonable and competitive in the Mannheim rental market.\n\nHowever, before we can finalize the rental agreement, I would like to clarify a few points. Firstly, would you be willing to sign a lease agreement for a minimum of one year? This will provide me with greater stability and security in terms of my rental income.\n\nSecondly, would you be able to pay the rental price in advance on a monthly basis? This will help me to better manage my cash flow and ensure that I am receiving timely payments.\n\nFinally, would you be able to provide any references or proof of your ability to pay the rental price on time? This will help me to assess your creditworthiness and make sure that you are a responsible tenant.\n\nIf you are able to address these points, I would be happy to agree to the rental price of x Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
