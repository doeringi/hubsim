Based on our discussions, I propose a rental price of 600 euros per month. This is a fair market value for a 25 square meter apartment in this area.

I understand that you need some time to consider the proposal. In the meantime, you can secure the rental agreement in writing by signing a lease agreement with the landlord. This will legally bind you to the terms and conditions of the rental agreement, including the rental price, payment schedule, and any other relevant details. Once you have signed the lease agreement, you can proceed with the negotiation and sign the final rental agreement once you have reached an agreement with the landlord.", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi"}, {"content": "I have consulted with my family and my financial situation, and I am willing to agree to the rental price of 600 euros per month.
