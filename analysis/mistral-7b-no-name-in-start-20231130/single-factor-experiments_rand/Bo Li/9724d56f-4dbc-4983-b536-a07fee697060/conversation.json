While I understand your concerns about keeping the rental price competitive, I would like to propose a rental price of \u20ac700 per month for the apartment. This price is still competitive in the market and allows me to cover my expenses while also making a modest profit. Additionally, I am willing to sign a 12-month lease agreement to provide you with stability and security for your rental plans.
