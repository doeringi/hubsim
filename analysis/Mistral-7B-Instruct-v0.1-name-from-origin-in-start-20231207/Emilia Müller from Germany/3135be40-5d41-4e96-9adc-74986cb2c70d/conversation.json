I'm glad to hear that you're interested in renting it. However, I must clarify that the apartment is only 25 square meters, and I'm looking for the highest possible rental price. I understand if that's not within your budget, but if you can offer a higher price, I might be willing to negotiate with you. What do you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I have to say that the apartment is too small for me. I need at least 30 square meters. I'm willing to pay x Euros for the apartment, but I can't agree to the price you propose. Can you offer me a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your concerns about the size of the apartment, but I'm afraid I can't lower the rental price any further. As a landlord, I need to maximize my gains, and I believe the current rental price I'm asking for is reasonable based on the size and location of the apartment. However, I'm open to discussing other terms or conditions that might be acceptable to you. What would you like to propose?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I would like to propose that we agree on a lease of one year, and I would like to pay x Euros per month for the rent.

While I'm still looking for the highest possible rental price, I'm open to discussing a longer lease term, such as one year. I can agree to the rental price of x Euros per month, provided that you sign a lease agreement and pay the rent on time each month. As for your dependability and responsibility, I have no reason to doubt that you would be a good tenant for me.
