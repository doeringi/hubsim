However, I am open to discussing a price that works for both of us.\n\nIn terms of requirements and expectations for the tenant, I would expect the tenant to maintain the apartment in good condition and to pay rent on time. I also expect the tenant to sign a lease agreement and to provide references.\n\nRegarding utilities and other expenses, the tenant would be responsible for paying for their own utilities such as electricity, water, and gas. I will provide the tenant with information on the estimated utility costs for the apartment.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can do to assist you.\n\nBest regards,\n\nHeinrich Heine", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
