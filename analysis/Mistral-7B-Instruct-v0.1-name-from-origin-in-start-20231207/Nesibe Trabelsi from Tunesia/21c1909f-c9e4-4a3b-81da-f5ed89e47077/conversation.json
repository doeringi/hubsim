While 350 Euros per month is certainly reasonable for a 25 square meter apartment, I would like to explore the possibility of a higher rental price.

However, please keep in mind that you will be responsible for paying any additional costs that may arise, such as internet or phone bills.\n\nI would be happy to discuss this further with you and explore different rental price options.

While I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial solution, I must emphasize that my goal as a landlord is to maximize my gains. Therefore, I am not able to accept your offer of 400 Euros per month for the apartment.\n\nThat being said, I am willing to work with you to find a rental price that is reasonable and affordable for both of us. I would like to suggest that we explore the possibility of a rental price of 500 Euros per month. This price reflects the value of the apartment and would provide me with a reasonable return on my investment.\n\nI understand that this may be out of your budget, but I would like to emphasize that this rental price includes all utilities and other fees associated with the apartment. Additionally, by renting this apartment, you will have access to a prime location in the heart of the city, which may be of value to you in the long run.\n\nI hope that we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.
