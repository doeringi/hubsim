The deposit amount is 200 Euros and it will be returned to you upon the end of the lease agreement, provided that you have fulfilled all your obligations.\n\nPets are not allowed in the apartment. You are not allowed to have a roommate without my prior approval. The noise level in the apartment should be kept to a minimum, and smoking and drugs are strictly prohibited. You are not allowed to have parties in the apartment. Late payments will result in a penalty fee.\n\nThere is no parking space included, but there are several public parking options nearby. You can have a balcony, but you are responsible for maintaining it. Garbage disposal is the responsibility of the tenant. Cleaning and maintenance of the apartment are also the responsibility of the tenant. There is a laundry room nearby, and you can use electricity and gas in the apartment, but water usage is limited. Internet and cable TV are available, but you will need to subscribe for them separately.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you for the information.
