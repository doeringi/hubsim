# Simulating Human Behavior With Open Source
This repository includes all code and ressources from the Masters Team Project at University of Mannheim.

We comprehensively analyze and evaluate contemporary open
source large language models (LLMs) by simulating landlord-renter negotiations.

- The code is available under [components](/components/)
- All prompt parts are stored in [assets](/assets/)
- All generated negotiations can be found in [single-factor-experiments](/single-factor-experiments/)
- All generated interviews can be found in [evaluation-agent-interviews](/evaluation-agent-interviews/)
- Both interview parser and conversation parser can be found in  [parsing](/parsing/)

For more detailed information please refer to the paper in the folder [final-report](/final-report/).
