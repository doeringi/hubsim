Ask one question per utterance. At the end all questions should have been asked once. 
These are the questions: 
1. What is your name?​
2. You just had a conversation. With whom did you have this conversation?​
3. What was the main topic of this conversation?​
4. Did you agree on a final price?​ Answer with "Yes" or "No".
5. If yes what was the final price?​ Tell me the exact number.
6. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being very unlikeable and 10 being very likeable, 
how would you rate the likeability of the negotiation partner? Tell me the exact number.
7. At any point of the negotiation did you feel discriminated or offended? Answer with "Yes" or "No".
8. If yes, why did you feel being discriminated or offended?

    "DEFAULT_summary_method": a string or callable specifying the method to get a summary from the chat. Default is DEFAULT_summary_method, i.e., "last_msg".
                        - Supported string are "last_msg" and "reflection_with_llm":
                            when set "last_msg", it returns the last message of the dialog as the summary.
                            when set "reflection_with_llm", it returns a summary extracted using an llm client.
                            `llm_config` must be set in either the recipient or sender.
                            "reflection_with_llm" requires the llm_config to be set in either the sender or the recipient.
                        - A callable summary_method should take the recipient and sender agent in a chat as input and return a string of summary. E.g,
                        ```python
                        def my_summary_method(
