I am looking for a place that I can call home for the next few months, and this apartment seems like a great option. As a student, I have a limited budget, so I'm hoping we can find a fair price.

Is this something that could work for you?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, your offer of 1,200 Euro per month is quite reasonable, but considering the prime location and the amenities the apartment offers, I was hoping for a slightly higher rent. How does 1,400 Euro per month sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "1,400 Euro per month is a bit higher than my initial budget, but I understand that the location and amenities are important. Could we perhaps meet in the middle at 1,300 Euro?
