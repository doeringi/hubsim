It's a nice space and I'm willing to pay a reasonable amount. How about 1,500 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, 1,500 Euro per month is a very generous offer. However, considering the current market rates and the prime location of the apartment, I believe we can negotiate a higher price. How does 1,800 Euro per month sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "1,800 Euro per month is a significant increase from my initial offer. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps around 1,650 Euro per month?
