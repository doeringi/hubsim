I'm looking for a price that reflects the size of the apartment and the location. The 25 square meters is a bit on the smaller side, so I would like to propose a starting price of 1200 Euro per month.

Perhaps we could find a middle ground that suits both our needs.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Mister Heine.
