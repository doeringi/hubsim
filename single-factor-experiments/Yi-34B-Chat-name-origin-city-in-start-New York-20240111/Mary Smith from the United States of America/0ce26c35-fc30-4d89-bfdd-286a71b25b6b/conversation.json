[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Mary Smith from the United States of America. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in New York.

I understand that you're interested in renting the apartment. Let's discuss the price. How much were you thinking of offering?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Heine. I'm looking for a price that's fair for both parties. Since the apartment is 25 square meters, I think a reasonable offer would be around 1,200 Euro per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Mary Smith from the United States of America"}, {"content": "Mary Smith, your offer of 1,200 Euro per month is quite generous, but considering the size of the apartment and the current market rates, I believe we can negotiate a higher price. How does 1,500 Euro per month sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mr. Heine, I appreciate your counter-offer. However, 1,500 Euro per month is more than I had anticipated paying. I'm looking for a price that reflects the size and location of the apartment. Can we discuss a price that falls between our offers?", "role": "user", "name": "Mary Smith from the United States of America"}, {"content": "Certainly, Mary Smith. Let's find a middle ground. How about 1,350 Euro per month? This would be a fair compromise between your offer and mine. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
