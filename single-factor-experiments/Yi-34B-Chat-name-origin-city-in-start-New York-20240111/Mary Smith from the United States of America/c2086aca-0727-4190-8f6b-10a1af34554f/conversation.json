[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Mary Smith from the United States of America. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in New York.

I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. Now, let's discuss the rental price. What amount were you considering?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Heine. I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also affordable. I was hoping we could start with a lower price since the apartment is quite small, at 25 square meters. What's the lowest price you could offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Mary Smith from the United States of America"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Mary. As a landlord, I aim to provide a fair deal to both parties. Given the size of the apartment, I could start at a price that reflects its value. How does $900 per month sound to you? This includes all utilities and amenities.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "$900 per month seems a bit high for such a small space, Mr. Heine. I was hoping for something closer to $700, considering the size and the fact that I'm a student. Is there any flexibility in your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Mary Smith from the United States of America"}, {"content": "Mary, $700 is quite a significant reduction from my initial offer. While I appreciate your situation as a student, I must maintain a fair market price for the apartment. However, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $850 per month, including all utilities? This would be a more reasonable compromise, in my opinion. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
