I'm a student, and I'm looking for a place that's both affordable and suitable for my needs. I'm willing to pay a fair price that reflects the size and location of the apartment.

As a student, I'm on a tight budget, so I'm hoping to find a place that doesn't stretch my finances too much. I'd be willing to pay a monthly rent of $1,200 for the apartment.

However, I must admit that I was hoping for a slightly higher rent, given the demand for apartments in this area. How about we meet in the middle and say $1,350? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the amenities and the proximity to campus. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
