I'm looking to rent an apartment in New York, and your place seems like a great fit. I'm a student, so I'm looking for a place that's both dependable and affordable.

For the 25 square meters apartment, I would initially consider a rental price of 1,500 Euro per month.

How does this price compare to your expectations, Mr. Smith?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing the initial price, Mr. Heine. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, as a student, I'm looking to save as much as possible while still having a comfortable place to live. 1,500 Euro per month is a bit higher than my budget allows. I was hoping for something closer to 1,200 Euro per month.

How about we start with a price that is closer to the middle ground, say 1,350 Euro per month? This would be a good starting point for our negotiation.
