While 1200 Euro is a fair price, I believe the apartment's prime location and amenities justify a slightly higher rental fee. How about 1350 Euro per month?

I'm really looking for something that won't stretch my finances too much. Could we perhaps meet in the middle? Say, 1250 Euro per month? This would be more manageable for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Maria Mamani from Bolivia"}, {"content": "I understand your budget concerns, Maria. As a landlord, I want to provide a fair deal to both parties. Let's compromise. How about 1300 Euro per month? This should be a more equitable price for both our needs.
