What is your budget for a place like this?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Heine. I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also within my budget. I'm a student, so I'm quite mindful of expenses. I'd like to keep the rent as low as possible. Could we start with a figure that's lower than the market rate?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student and want to keep costs down. As a landlord, I'm willing to negotiate a fair price that works for both of us. How much were you thinking of paying for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I was hoping to find something around 500 Euros per month, considering the size of the apartment and my student status. Is that a price we could discuss?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "500 Euros per month is quite a low figure for an apartment in New York, especially considering the current market rates. However, I'm open to discussing a price that reflects the value of the apartment while taking into account your student status. How does 750 Euros per month sound to you? It's a fair price that offers you a discount while still being profitable for me as a landlord.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
