[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Baihu Li from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in New York.

I understand that you are interested in renting the apartment. Let's discuss the price and find a mutually agreeable amount.

Since the apartment is a decent size at 25 square meters, I would like to propose a monthly rent of $1,200. Is this a price that you would consider?", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Baihu Li. However, I must be honest with you. Given the location and the demand for apartments in New York, I was hoping for a slightly higher rent. How about we start with $1,500 per month? This would reflect the market value and the convenience of living in such a vibrant city. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, your counter-offer is higher than what I had in mind. While the location is certainly attractive, I must consider my budget as a student. Could we perhaps meet halfway? A price of $1,350 would be more in line with what I am able to pay. This would still be a fair deal for both parties, in my opinion.", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Baihu Li. As a student, budget constraints are understandable. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we settle on $1,400 per month?
