The size of the apartment is 25 square meters, which is quite suitable for me. I'm a student, and I'm willing to pay a reasonable amount for the convenience of living here.

As a student, I'm on a budget, and I'm looking to keep my expenses as low as possible. I'm sure we can find a price that's more in line with what I can afford. How about we start with $1,200 per month?

The market value for apartments of this size in this area is closer to what I initially proposed. However, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350 per month? This would be a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
