As for the rent, I would expect it to be at least \u20ac1000 per month, given the size and location of the apartment.

However, given the size and location of the apartment, I believe a rental price of \u20ac800 per month is not a fair market rate. I would expect to receive at least \u20ac1000 per month for this apartment.\n\nRegarding utilities, I'm afraid I cannot agree to your request to pay for them yourself. The utilities cost is a separate expense that the tenant is responsible for, and I cannot waive that requirement.\n\nI appreciate your interest in the apartment, but I'm afraid we cannot agree on these terms. I hope you understand and wish you the best of luck in your search.\n\nBest regards,\n\nHeinrich Heine", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
