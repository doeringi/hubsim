But I am sure that won't be a problem for you.\n\nSo, what do you think? Do we have a deal for 800 Euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I think the price is too high.\n\nI will leave now.

However, I would like to remind you that this apartment is in high demand due to its prime location and new construction. I am willing to negotiate, but I cannot go too low.\n\nIf you change your mind, please let me know. I would be happy to discuss a lower price with you. Have a good day.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
