In terms of the rental price, I would like to propose a starting point of 500 Euros per month. This price reflects the location and the quality of the apartment, and I believe it is a fair market value. Of course, I am open to discussing any potential adjustments or concessions, but I would like to emphasize that I am a landlord who wants to maximize my gains.

However, I am willing to pay a deposit of 200 Euros upfront. This way, if I decide to move out before the end of the lease, you will not lose any rent. If you agree to this offer, we can discuss the terms and conditions of the lease agreement.
