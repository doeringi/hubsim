[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a great place to live. So, let's discuss the rental price. How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm looking for a fair price, considering the location and the amenities. Could we start with \u20ac900 per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I'm sorry, but that's far too low for an apartment of this quality in the city center. I'm looking for a tenant who appreciates the value of this property. Is there anything else you'd like to offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that the location is prime, and I'm willing to pay a fair price. How about \u20ac950? I think that's a reasonable offer considering the size and the proximity to amenities.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, you're not even close to what I'm asking for. This apartment is brand new, and the demand for such a place is high.

How about you reconsider your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry if my offer came across as too low.

This apartment is worth more than what you're offering. I'm looking for a serious tenant who is willing to pay a fair market price.
