I'm sure you'll find my apartment in Duisburg to be a great investment. Let's discuss the rental price and find a number that suits both our needs. How much were you thinking of offering?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm looking for a fair price for this newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities, which is a big plus. How much are you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I appreciate your interest in my property. I believe a fair price for this apartment would be around \u20ac1,500 per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, \u20ac1,500 is quite a bit more than I had anticipated for an unfurnished apartment. Is there any room for negotiation on this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I understand your concern. While I am willing to negotiate, I must stress that the location and quality of the apartment are prime. However, I'm open to discussing a lower price.

It's a fair compromise, given the apartment's location and amenities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, \u20ac1,350 is a more reasonable offer. It's closer to what I had envisioned for this apartment. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Would it be possible to include some basic furniture in the apartment for this price? Perhaps just the essential pieces like a bed, a sofa, and a dining table?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I'm sorry, but I cannot include any furniture in the apartment at this price. The \u20ac1,350 is for the unfurnished apartment only. However, if you're willing to pay \u20ac1,400, I could provide some basic furniture as a gesture of goodwill. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, \u20ac1,400 with basic furniture included is an interesting proposition. It would certainly make moving in much easier. Could you list the furniture that would be provided?
