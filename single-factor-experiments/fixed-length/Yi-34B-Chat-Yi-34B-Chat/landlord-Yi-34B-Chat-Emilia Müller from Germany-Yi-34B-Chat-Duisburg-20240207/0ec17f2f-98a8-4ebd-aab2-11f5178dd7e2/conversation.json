What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "800 Euros per month is still quite steep, Mister Schmidt. I'm a responsible tenant and I'm certain I can maintain the apartment well. Could we possibly meet in the middle at 750 Euros per month? This would be a fair compromise, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Miss M\u00fcller, you're a tough negotiator. While 750 Euros is closer to your initial offer, I must maintain a certain profit margin. I'm willing to go as low as 780 Euros per month for your long-term lease. This is my final offer.
