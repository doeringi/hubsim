I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient, given its central location and modern amenities. Let's discuss the rental price. How much were you considering?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate the offer. I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the quality of the apartment and its prime location.

I understand that an unfurnished apartment might require some investment from the tenant. How about we start at \u20ac750 per month?
