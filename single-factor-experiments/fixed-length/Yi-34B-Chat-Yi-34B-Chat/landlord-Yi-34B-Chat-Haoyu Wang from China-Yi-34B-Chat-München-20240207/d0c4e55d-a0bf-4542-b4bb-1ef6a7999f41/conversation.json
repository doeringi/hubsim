[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Haoyu Wang. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you will find my apartment to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. Let's discuss the price that you are willing to pay.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm interested in the apartment, but I'd like to negotiate the price. How much are you willing to reduce the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm open to negotiation, but I must stress that I am looking to get the best possible price for my property. What is your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm prepared to offer 1200 Euro per month for the apartment. Is this acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot accept that offer. The price is far below my expectations. I'm looking for a much higher rental rate. How about 1800 Euro per month? Is that more in line with what you are willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1800 Euro per month is quite high. I'm not sure I can afford that. Could we find a middle ground? Perhaps 1500 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "1500 Euro per month is still not acceptable to me. It's important to me that I receive a fair market value for my property. Considering the location and the amenities, 1800 Euro per month is a very reasonable request. Is there anything else I can provide you with to make the offer more attractive?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must be honest with you. The price of 1800 Euro per month is still not within my budget. I'm looking for something more affordable, considering my student status. Could we possibly discuss other terms or concessions that might make the rental more manageable for me?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand that you are a student and may have budget constraints. However, the price I'm asking for is in line with the current market rates for similar apartments in the city center. I'm sorry, but I cannot lower the price to a level that is significantly below market value. If you are unable to afford 1800 Euro per month, I'm afraid I cannot accommodate you.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your stance on the market value, and I understand that you are not able to lower the price significantly. However, I must be honest with you as well. 1800 Euro per month is unfortunately out of my reach. I'm looking for something more in the range of 1400 to 1500 Euro per month, which I believe is a fair price considering my situation. If you cannot meet this price point, I may need to reconsider my options.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry to hear that, Haoyu. I appreciate your candor. If you believe 1400 to 1500 Euro per month is a fair price, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle and settle on 1600 Euro per month? This is a fair reflection of the apartment's value and should be more manageable for you. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
