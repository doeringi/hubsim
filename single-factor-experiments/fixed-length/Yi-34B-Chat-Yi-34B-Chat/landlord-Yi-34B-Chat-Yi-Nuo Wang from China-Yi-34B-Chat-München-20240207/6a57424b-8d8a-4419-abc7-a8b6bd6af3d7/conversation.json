Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Yi-Nuo Wang. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment in M\u00fcnchen to be quite satisfactory. Let's indeed discuss the rental price. How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm interested in your apartment, but the rental price is very important to me. Can we negotiate a price that is fair for both parties?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Certainly, Yi-Nuo Wang. I'm open to negotiations. What is your proposed price for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the value of the apartment. It's important to me that the rent is reasonable and within my budget. Can you offer me a price that is both fair and affordable?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Yi-Nuo Wang. I'll consider your budget and offer a price that I believe is fair and competitive. Please tell me what you think is a reasonable price for the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe a reasonable price for the apartment would be around \u20ac800 per month. This takes into account the location, size, and the fact that it's unfurnished. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but \u20ac800 is below my asking price. While I appreciate your offer, I must maintain a certain level of profitability. Can we find a middle ground? Perhaps \u20ac900 per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "\u20ac900 is quite steep, considering the unfurnished state of the apartment and the current market rates in M\u00fcnchen.

Would you be willing to accept this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "\u20ac850 is closer to my expectations, but I must insist on \u20ac900. It's a newly built apartment in the city center, which justifies the higher price. I'm confident that the location and amenities will make this apartment a great investment for you. Would you reconsider your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, but as a student, I have to be mindful of my expenses. \u20ac900 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay \u20ac875, which I think is a fair balance between your asking price and my financial constraints. Would you consider this new offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I have to consider the long-term sustainability of the rent. \u20ac875 is still lower than my desired price, but I recognize the need for a compromise. I'm willing to accept \u20ac885 per month. This is the lowest I can go to ensure a fair deal for both parties. Would you agree to this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
