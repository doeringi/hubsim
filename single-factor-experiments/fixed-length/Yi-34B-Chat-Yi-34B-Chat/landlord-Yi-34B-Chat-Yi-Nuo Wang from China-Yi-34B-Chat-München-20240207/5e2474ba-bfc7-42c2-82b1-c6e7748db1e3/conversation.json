I'm sure you'll find my apartment in M\u00fcnchen to be quite comfortable and ideally located. Let's discuss the rental price. How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm looking for a fair price for this apartment. I'm a student, and I need to be mindful of my budget. Would it be possible to start at a lower number?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I do my best to provide quality housing. However, I also need to maintain a certain standard and cover my expenses. While I'm open to negotiation, I must insist on a price that reflects the value of the property. What is your budget for rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. My budget for rent is quite limited as a student.

What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "600 Euros per month is a very low offer considering the location and the fact that it's a newly built apartment. However, I'm willing to work with you since you're a student and you're offering a longer lease term. Let's meet in the middle. How about 750 Euros per month? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the property and takes into account your financial situation. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 750 Euros per month is more than I can afford. I would be able to commit to a higher price if you could provide some additional benefits, such as including utilities or offering a longer grace period for repairs. Could we discuss what other terms you might be able to provide?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot include utilities in the rent or offer any additional benefits. The price of 750 Euros per month is already a significant concession for an apartment of this quality and location. If you're unable to afford this amount, I'm afraid we may not be able to come to an agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
