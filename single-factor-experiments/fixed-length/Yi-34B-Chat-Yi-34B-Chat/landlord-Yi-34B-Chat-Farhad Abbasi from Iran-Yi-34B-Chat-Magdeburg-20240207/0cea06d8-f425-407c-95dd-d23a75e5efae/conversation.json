[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

It's a great location with all the amenities you need. What price were you considering for the rental?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate the quality of the apartment and the convenient location. I was thinking that a fair price would be around 500 Euros per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I can't accept that price. It's far too low for the value of the apartment. I'm looking for a price that reflects the investment I've made in this property. How about we start at 800 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Mister Schmidt. The investment you've made is significant. However, I'm a student with a limited budget. Could we find a middle ground? Perhaps we could start at 650 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "650 Euros is still not acceptable to me. I need to cover my costs and make a profit. I'm willing to negotiate, but you need to understand that I'm not going to let the apartment go for less than it's worth. Let's meet in the middle at 725 Euros per month. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of 725 Euros per month is more reasonable. However, as a student, I'm still looking to keep my expenses as low as possible. Would you consider 675 Euros per month as a fair compromise? This would help me manage my budget while still compensating you fairly for the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 675 Euros is simply not enough for me. I need to cover my mortgage, maintenance costs, and make a small profit. I'm willing to listen to your situation, but I can't go below 700 Euros per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I understand your position. 700 Euros per month is more acceptable to me, considering the investment you've made.
