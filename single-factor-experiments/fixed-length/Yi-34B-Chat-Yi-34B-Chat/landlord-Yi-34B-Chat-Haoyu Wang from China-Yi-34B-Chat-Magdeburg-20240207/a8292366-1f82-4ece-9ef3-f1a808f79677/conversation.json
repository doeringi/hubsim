[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

I'm sure you'll find my apartment to be a great place to live. How much are you considering to pay for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the value of the apartment.

Can you tell me what your initial asking price is?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Haoyu, I'm sure we can find a price that suits both of us. Since the apartment is brand new and in a prime location, I was thinking of an initial asking price of 800 Euro per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your apartment sounds like it offers a lot of value with its central location and new construction. However, I'm looking to negotiate the best price possible. Can you consider a lower starting point?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Haoyu, I understand that you're looking to negotiate.

What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 725 Euro per month is a more reasonable proposition. It's closer to what I had in mind. Would it be possible to include some basic furniture, like a bed and a sofa, at this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Haoyu, I'm sorry, but I cannot include any furniture at this price. The apartment is advertised as unfurnished, and I want to keep it that way. However, I'm willing to negotiate on the price further if you're interested. How does 710 Euro per month sound to you? This is as low as I can go for an unfurnished apartment of this quality and location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 710 Euro per month is quite attractive for an apartment of this caliber. However, I'm still looking to shave off a bit more. How about 700 Euro per month, considering the unfurnished state? This would be a win-win for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Haoyu, you're pushing for a good deal. I'll consider your offer, but I need to make sure it's sustainable for me as a landlord. Let's meet in the middle again. How about 705 Euro per month?
