What price did you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I understand your position. I'm looking for a place that not only meets my needs but also fits within my budget. I'd like to propose a price that reflects the value of the apartment and the city center location. Would you be willing to start at 500 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Yi-Nuo, your offer of 500 Euros per month is quite low for an apartment of this quality in the city center. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must ask for a price that reflects the market value and the amenities this apartment provides. Would you be willing to reconsider your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I respect your position.

Given its location and features, I believe 800 Euros per month is a fair and competitive price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at 750 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your persistence is commendable. The location and features of the apartment are indeed exceptional. I'm prepared to make another offer in an effort to reach a mutual agreement. How about 725 Euros per month? This is my final offer, as it aligns with my budget and reflects my commitment to a fair deal.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Yi-Nuo, your final offer of 725 Euros per month is closer to my expectations, but it's still not the price I'm seeking. The apartment's location in the city center, its new construction, and the amenities it offers justify a higher rental price. I'm sorry, but I cannot accept your offer. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is not fair for the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
