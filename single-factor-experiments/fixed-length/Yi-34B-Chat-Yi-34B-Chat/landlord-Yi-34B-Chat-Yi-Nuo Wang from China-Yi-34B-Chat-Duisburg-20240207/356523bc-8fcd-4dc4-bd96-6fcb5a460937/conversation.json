[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Yi-Nuo Wang. I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. Let's indeed discuss the price. How much are you willing to pay per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm looking for a fair price for this newly built, unfurnished apartment in the city center. It's a great location, close to all the important facilities. How much are you asking for it?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As you mentioned, the location is prime, and the apartment is brand new. I'm looking to get the best possible return on my investment. I'm willing to consider offers starting from 1,000 Euro per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 1,000 Euro per month is quite high for an unfurnished apartment. I'm a student, so I'm on a budget. Is there any room for negotiation?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I have to consider the cost of maintaining such a prime location. However, I'm willing to be flexible for the right tenant. What is your maximum budget?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, my maximum budget for this apartment is 700 Euro per month. I believe it's a fair price considering the unfurnished state and my status as a student. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "700 Euro per month is significantly lower than my initial asking price. While I understand your budget constraints, I must maintain a certain level of return on my investment. How about we meet at 850 Euro per month? It's a fair compromise, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 850 Euro per month is still quite high for an unfurnished apartment, especially for a student like me. I'm willing to pay 750 Euro per month, which I think is a more reasonable price for both parties. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Your offer of 750 Euro per month is closer to my expectations, but I'm afraid it's still not quite there. How about we settle at 800 Euro per month? This is the lowest I can go, considering the location and the quality of the apartment. What's your final decision?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 800 Euro per month is still a bit steep for me, but I understand the value of the location. I'm prepared to offer 780 Euro per month, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price for all parties involved. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Your offer of 780 Euro per month is very close to my final offer of 800 Euro. However, I must insist on the 800 Euro per month to cover my expenses and provide a fair return on my investment. This is my final offer. If you agree to this price, we can proceed with the lease. If not, I understand, and we can part ways amicably.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
