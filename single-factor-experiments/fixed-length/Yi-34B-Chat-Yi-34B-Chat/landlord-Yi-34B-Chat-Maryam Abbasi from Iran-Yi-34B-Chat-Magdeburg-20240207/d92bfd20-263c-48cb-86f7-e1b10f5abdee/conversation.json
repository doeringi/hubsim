I'm sure you will find the apartment to be in an excellent location with all the amenities you need. So, what price did you have in mind for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm interested in the apartment, and I think it has great potential. However, I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the current market conditions.

As the landlord, I aim to receive the highest possible rent for my property. However, I'm willing to negotiate a price that is acceptable to both parties.

I appreciate your time and effort. As a student, I'm on a tight budget, so I'm looking for a price that is within my means.

What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, your offer is quite close to my lowest possible rate.
