I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much were you thinking of offering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Mister Schmidt, I'm a student, so I'm looking for a reasonable price. The apartment seems nice, and since it's newly built and in the city center, I understand it might be a bit more expensive. But I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that's fair for both of us.

Is this within your range?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "650 Euros per month is an interesting offer, Maryam.

While I appreciate the quality and location of the apartment, this price is not within my budget. I'd like to propose a compromise. How about 750 Euros per month?
