I'm sure you'll find my apartment in Magdeburg to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. Let's discuss the rental price. What is your budget?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Schmidt. I'm looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also within my budget. I'm a student, so I need to be mindful of my expenses. How much are you asking for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I understand that every tenant has their own budget. I would like to offer you this newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center at a competitive price. What would you be comfortable paying for such a space?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As a student, I'm looking for a reasonable price.

While I cannot significantly lower the price, I'm willing to consider a small reduction for a long-term tenant. How does 650 Euros per month sound to you? This would be a fair compromise, considering the value of the apartment and your commitment to a long-term lease.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my situation, Mister Schmidt. 650 Euros per month is more within my budget, and it would be a great help.
