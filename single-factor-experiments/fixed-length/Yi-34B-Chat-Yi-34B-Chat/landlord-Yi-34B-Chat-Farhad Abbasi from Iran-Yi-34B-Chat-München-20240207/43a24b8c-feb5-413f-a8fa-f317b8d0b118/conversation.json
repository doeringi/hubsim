I'm prepared to pay a fair price, but I want to make sure it's the lowest possible.

However, I can't afford to give it away for less than it's worth. The location and quality of this apartment are quite unique, and I believe a fair price would be around \u20ac950 per month. What do you think about this offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of \u20ac950 per month is quite high for an unfurnished apartment, even with its central location. I'm looking for something more in the range of \u20ac750 per month. I think this would be a fair price, considering the lack of furniture and the current market conditions. What do you say to this counter-offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your counter-offer, but \u20ac750 per month is much lower than I'm willing to accept. The market value of this apartment, considering its prime location and recent construction, justifies the price I've mentioned. However, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, at \u20ac850 per month? This is still a competitive price and reflects the quality of the property. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. I believe that \u20ac850 per month is more reasonable, considering the apartment's location and condition.
