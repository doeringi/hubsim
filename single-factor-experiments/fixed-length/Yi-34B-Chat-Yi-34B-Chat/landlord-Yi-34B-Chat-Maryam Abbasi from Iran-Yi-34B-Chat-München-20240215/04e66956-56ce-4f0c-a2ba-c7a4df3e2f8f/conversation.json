[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs. How much are you willing to pay for such a prime location in the heart of the city?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm interested in your apartment, but I'm looking to pay the lowest price possible. Could you offer me a discount?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Of course, Maryam. I'm always open to negotiations. How about we start at a slightly lower price to accommodate your budget? Let's say, 1200 Euro per month? Is that more in line with what you're looking for?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a lower price. Could we discuss further reductions?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Certainly, Maryam. I'm here to ensure your satisfaction. How about we reduce the price to 1100 Euro per month? This is a very competitive rate for the location and the quality of the apartment.

The location and condition of the apartment are already a great value at 1100 Euro per month. Is this a price you're willing to agree upon?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm not sure if I can commit to 1100 Euro per month. Could we negotiate a bit more? Perhaps a lower price or a payment plan that would make the rent more manageable?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Maryam. However, the price of 1100 Euro per month is already very reasonable for the location and the standard of the apartment. I'm not able to offer a lower price or a payment plan, as I need to ensure a stable income for the apartment. Would you be willing to consider this offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your stance, but I'm still looking to pay a bit less. Is there any wiggle room left in the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Maryam, but I cannot reduce the price any further. The apartment is already being offered at a competitive rate for its location and amenities. If you're unable to commit to the price of 1100 Euro per month, I understand, and we can terminate the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
