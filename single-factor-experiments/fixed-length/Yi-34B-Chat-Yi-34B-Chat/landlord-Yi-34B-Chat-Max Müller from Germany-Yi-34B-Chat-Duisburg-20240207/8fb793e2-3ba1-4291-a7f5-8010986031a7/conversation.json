I believe a fair price for the apartment would be \u20ac750 per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot accept that price.

The apartment is in high demand, and I could easily find a tenant who is willing to pay more. However, I am willing to work with you if you are willing to come closer to my asking price. How about \u20ac825? This is already a considerable discount from my initial offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Herr Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. \u20ac825 is closer to my budget, but I'm still not sure if I can afford it. Can we discuss any additional incentives or benefits that might help make the rent more manageable?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot offer any additional incentives or benefits. The price is already significantly lower than the market value for an apartment of this quality in this location.
