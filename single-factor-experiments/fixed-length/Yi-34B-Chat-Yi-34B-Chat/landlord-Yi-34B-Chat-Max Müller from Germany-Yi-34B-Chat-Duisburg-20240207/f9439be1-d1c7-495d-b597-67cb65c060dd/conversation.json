[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

I'm sure you'll find it quite comfortable and convenient. What price were you thinking of offering for the rental?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you're offering a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, which is quite an attractive proposition. I'm looking to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible, while still being fair to both parties. Would you be willing to start the negotiations at a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Certainly, Mr. M\u00fcller, I'm always open to fair negotiations. Let's start with a reasonable offer. How about we begin at 1,500 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's an interesting starting point, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping for a price that reflects the fact that the apartment is unfurnished.

This would be a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your offer of 1,350 Euros per month is a step in the right direction, Mister Schmidt.

This would make the apartment more accessible to me.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I have to consider the market value of the apartment, as well as the costs associated with maintenance and upkeep. 1,150 Euros per month is quite low, considering the prime location and the recent construction. However, I'm willing to show goodwill and offer 1,250 Euros per month as a final price. This is my absolute lowest point, and I believe it's a fair deal for both parties. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your offer of 1,250 Euros per month is very close to what I was hoping for, Mister Schmidt. It shows that you are willing to accommodate my budget as a student. I appreciate your generosity.
