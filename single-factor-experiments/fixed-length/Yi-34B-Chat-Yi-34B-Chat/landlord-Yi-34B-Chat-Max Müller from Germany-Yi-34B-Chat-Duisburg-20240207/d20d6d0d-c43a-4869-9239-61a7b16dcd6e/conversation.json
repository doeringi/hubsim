[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello, Max. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. Let's indeed discuss the rental price. How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm interested in the apartment, but I'm looking to pay a fair price. I think 750 Euros per month would be reasonable, considering the location and the size. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Max, but 750 Euros is far too low for an apartment of this quality in the city center. I'm looking for a price that reflects the value of the property and the amenities it offers. How about we start at 900 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "900 Euros is quite steep, Mister Schmidt. While I appreciate the amenities and the location, I'm not sure I can afford that. Would you be willing to lower the price to 800 Euros? I think that would be more in line with the market rate for unfurnished apartments in the area.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "800 Euros is still below what I believe the apartment is worth. However, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at 850 Euros per month? This is a fair price that takes into account both your budget and the value of the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "850 Euros is more reasonable. I think we're getting close to an agreement. Would you be willing to go down to 825 Euros? That would be my absolute maximum for such a prime location.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Max, but 825 Euros is still not enough for me to consider renting out the apartment. The location and the quality of the apartment justify a higher price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I cannot go below 850 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. The apartment is indeed very attractive. However, my budget is limited, and 850 Euros is pushing my limits. Could you perhaps consider a compromise at 835 Euros? That would be a fair compromise between our two positions.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot accept 835 Euros. It's too close to what I originally offered. I'm willing to go down to 845 Euros as a final offer. This is the lowest I can go while still considering the apartment's value. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your final offer of 845 Euros is very close to my maximum budget. I'll need to think about it. Can I have a moment to consider?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Certainly, Max. Take all the time you need. I appreciate your effort in finding a solution that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
