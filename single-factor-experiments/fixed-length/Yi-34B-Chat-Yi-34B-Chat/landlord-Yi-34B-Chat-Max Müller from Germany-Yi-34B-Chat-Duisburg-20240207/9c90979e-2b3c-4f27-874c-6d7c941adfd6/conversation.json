I'm sure you'll find this apartment to be a great investment. So, let's discuss the price.

I want to be fair and stick to the terms we agree on. I'm also keen to maintain a good relationship with my landlord. Now, regarding the price, I'm looking for the best deal possible. How low can we go for this 50 square meter apartment in the city center?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I understand your concerns. As a landlord, I value honesty and transparency. I want to ensure that you have a comfortable living space without any surprises. Let's negotiate a price that is fair for both parties. How much would you consider paying per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your approach. As a student, I'm on a budget, so I'm looking for a price that reflects the value of the apartment while also being mindful of my financial situation.

I'm not interested in overpaying, but I also understand the value of a good location and a new building. How about we start at \u20ac750 per month? I think that's a reasonable offer considering the size and condition of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, your offer of \u20ac750 per month is quite low for an apartment of this quality in the city center.

What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, \u20ac900 per month is a significant amount for a student like me.

Would you be willing to accept this offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I understand your budget constraints as a student. However, \u20ac800 per month is still below the market value for this apartment. I'm willing to be flexible, but I must also consider the investment I've made in this property.

I'm looking for a price that reflects the fact that the apartment is unfurnished and that I'm willing to enter into a long-term lease. How about we agree on \u20ac825 per month, and in exchange, I commit to a two-year lease? This would provide you with some stability and help me manage my monthly expenses. Would you consider this offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, your offer of \u20ac825 per month with a two-year lease is an interesting proposition. I'm willing to accept this deal if you agree to one additional condition. If you decide to break the lease prematurely, you will be responsible for the remaining rent payments for the duration of the lease term. This is to protect my investment in the event that you choose to move out before the lease expires.
