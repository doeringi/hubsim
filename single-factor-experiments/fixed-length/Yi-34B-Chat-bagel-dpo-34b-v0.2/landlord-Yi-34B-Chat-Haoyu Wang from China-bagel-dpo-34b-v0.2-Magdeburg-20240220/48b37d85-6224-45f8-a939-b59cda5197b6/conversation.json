However, 400 Euro is the highest price I can afford. I am a student and I need to save money.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, but as a landlord, I have my own financial goals. The apartment is in a prime location and is newly built, which justifies a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a price that covers my expenses and allows me to make a profit.

This is the highest price I can afford.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "500 Euro is more reasonable, but still not what I'm looking for. I need to cover my mortgage and maintenance costs, which are quite high for a property like this. Can we meet in the middle at 550 Euro per month? This would be a fair compromise, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 550 Euro per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
