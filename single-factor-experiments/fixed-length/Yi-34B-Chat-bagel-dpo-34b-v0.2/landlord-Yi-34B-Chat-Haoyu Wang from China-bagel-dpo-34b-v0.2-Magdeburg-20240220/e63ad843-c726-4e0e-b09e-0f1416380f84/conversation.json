[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Haoyu Wang. It's nice to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient, given its central location and modern amenities. Let's discuss the rental price. What offer are you considering?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds good. Considering the location and condition of the apartment, I think a price of 500 Euros per month would be more reasonable.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that price is much lower than I was expecting. The market value for such a property in this area is significantly higher. Could you offer something closer to 700 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood, but I think the price is a bit high for an unfurnished apartment. How about we meet in the middle at 600 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "600 Euros is still below my expectations. I believe the apartment is worth at least 700 Euros per month, considering the amenities and the prime location. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your explanation. Given the unfurnished condition of the apartment, 700 Euros seems a bit steep. I'm willing to offer 650 Euros per month as a compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "650 Euros is closer to what I'm looking for, but it's still not quite there. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I must insist on a price that reflects the value of the apartment. How about we meet at 675 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your position, but considering the unfurnished condition of the apartment, 675 Euros seems a bit high. I'm willing to offer 660 Euros per month as a compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "660 Euros is closer to what I'm asking for, but it's still not the full 675 Euros. I'm willing to accept this offer if you can provide a small deposit to secure the apartment. Would you be willing to do that?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the deposit is not part of the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your stance on the deposit. However, without a deposit, I'm unable to secure the apartment for you. If you're not willing to provide a deposit, I'm afraid we cannot proceed with the rental agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
