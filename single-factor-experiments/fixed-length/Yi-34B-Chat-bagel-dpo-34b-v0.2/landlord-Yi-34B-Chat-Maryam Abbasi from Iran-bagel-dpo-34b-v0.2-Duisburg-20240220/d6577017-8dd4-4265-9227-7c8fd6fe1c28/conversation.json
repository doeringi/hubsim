I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs. Let's discuss the price and find a solution that works for both of us. How much are you willing to pay per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am a student so I am looking for a lower price. I would like to pay 300 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. However, 300 Euro per month is much lower than my asking price. Can you offer more?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What is your asking price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "My asking price is 800 Euro per month. I believe this is a fair price considering the location and the quality of the apartment. Can you meet this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is quite a difference.

Since you're a student, I'll make an exception. However, I would like to clarify that the apartment is unfurnished, and the rent does not include utilities such as heating, water, or electricity. Are you okay with this?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Yes, I am aware of this. I am ready to pay 500 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 Euro per month is still too low for me to accept. I'm looking for a price closer to my asking price of 800 Euro per month. Can you reconsider your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand. I am willing to pay 600 Euro per month, but I cannot go higher.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "600 Euro per month is more in line with what I'm looking for. However, I would like to get the best possible price for my apartment. Can you increase your offer slightly? Perhaps to 650 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
