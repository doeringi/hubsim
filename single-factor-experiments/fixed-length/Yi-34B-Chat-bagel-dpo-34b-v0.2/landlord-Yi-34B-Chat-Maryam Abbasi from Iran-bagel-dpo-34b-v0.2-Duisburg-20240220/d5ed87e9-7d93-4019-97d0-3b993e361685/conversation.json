[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you will find the apartment to your liking. Now, let's discuss the rental price. What would you consider a fair price for this modern, city-center apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I would say 500 euros would be a good starting point. It's a nice apartment, but the furniture is not included, and the area, while central, is not the best in the city.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Maryam. However, I must inform you that the price is non-negotiable at this time. The apartment is newly built and located in the heart of the city, which justifies the asking price of 600 euros. I'm confident that once you see the apartment, you will understand the value it offers. Would you like to proceed with the viewing?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Yes, I would still like to see the apartment. I am a smart person, and I know that the location of this apartment is very convenient.

The location is great, and the apartment is very nice. However, I still think 600 euros is too much. I propose 550 euros instead.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Maryam, but I must decline. The apartment's location and quality justify the price of 600 euros. If you are interested in renting at this price, I would be happy to proceed with the lease. Otherwise, I will have to reconsider your application.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of [550] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot accept that price. The apartment is worth 600 euros, and I'm looking for a tenant who is willing to pay that amount. If you are not interested in renting at the asking price, I will have to consider other potential tenants.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the landlord is not willing to come down to 550 euros. I am willing to pay 550 euros and I think it is a fair price for this apartment, but the landlord does not agree. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}]
