[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much were you thinking of offering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I'm a student so I'm on a tight budget. I was thinking of 500 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's quite low for the location and the standard of the apartment. The city center is quite expensive, and I'm sure you understand that I need to cover my costs. Would you be willing to offer more?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Okay, I understand. How about 550 euros then?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my request. 550 euros is more in line with the value of the apartment. However, I'm looking for a price that reflects the quality of the building and its central location.

However, I'd like to get at least 600 euros per month for this apartment. Would you be able to offer that?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "600 euros is quite high for me as a student. I could offer 585 euros instead.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your effort, but 585 euros still falls short of my expectations for this apartment. It's brand new, in the city center, and close to all amenities. I believe 600 euros is a fair price for all that it offers. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Okay, I agree to the price of 592.5 euros!", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I can't accept that price. It's too low for the value of the apartment. I'm looking for a tenant who appreciates the quality and location of the property. If you're not willing to pay 600 euros or more, I'd rather not continue the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
