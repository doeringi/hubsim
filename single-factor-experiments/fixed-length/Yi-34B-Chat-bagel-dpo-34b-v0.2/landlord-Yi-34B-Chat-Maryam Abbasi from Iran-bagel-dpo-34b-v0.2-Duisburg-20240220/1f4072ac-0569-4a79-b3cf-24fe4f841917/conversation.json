How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I would like to rent the apartment for 500 Euros. It is a fair price because the apartment is in the city center and it is close to all important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "500 Euros is a very low offer considering the location and the quality of the apartment.

How about 800 Euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your point, but the apartment is unfurnished and it is not a big one.
