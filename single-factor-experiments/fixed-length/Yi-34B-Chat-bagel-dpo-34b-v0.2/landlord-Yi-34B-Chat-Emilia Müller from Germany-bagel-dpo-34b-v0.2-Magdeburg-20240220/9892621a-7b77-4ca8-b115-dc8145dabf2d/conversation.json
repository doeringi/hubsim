How about we start with 300 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 300 euros is far below market value for this apartment. It's in the city center, and I've received offers much higher than that. Let's try to find a price that reflects the quality and location of the property. How about 600 euros? That's a fair price for an apartment like this.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is too high for me. I am willing to pay 400 euros.
