I'm sure you'll find my apartment to be a great place to live.

The apartment is in the city center and very close to all amenities. I think a more reasonable price would be around 800 euros per month. What do you think about that?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your point of view.

If you can't afford 700 euros, I'm afraid I can't go any lower. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to decline your offer. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is too low for the value of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your position.
