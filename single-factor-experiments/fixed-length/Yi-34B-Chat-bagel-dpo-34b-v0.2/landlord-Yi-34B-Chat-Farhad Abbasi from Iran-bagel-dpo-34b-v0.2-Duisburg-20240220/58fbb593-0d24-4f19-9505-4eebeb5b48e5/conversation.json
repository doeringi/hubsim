I'm sure you'll find it quite comfortable and ideally located. What is the highest price you are willing to pay for a spacious, unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in the heart of the city?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Given the average market price for similar apartments in the city center, I would say around 800 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that price is much lower than what I'm looking for.

Would you be willing to negotiate a higher price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Of course, I am willing to negotiate.

While 925 euros is closer to my expectations, I would still prefer to get a bit more for this apartment. How about we settle at 975 euros per month?
