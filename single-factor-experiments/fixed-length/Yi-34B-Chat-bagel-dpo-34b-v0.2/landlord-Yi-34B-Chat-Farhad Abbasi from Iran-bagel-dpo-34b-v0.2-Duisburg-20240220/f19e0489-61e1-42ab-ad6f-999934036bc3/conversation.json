I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. So, let's discuss the price. What would you consider a fair rent for this place?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I would say 500 euros per month. It is a nice apartment but I am a student and I don't want to pay too much.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student, Farhad, and you're looking to save money. However, the location and the quality of the apartment are quite good, which justifies a higher price. How about we start a bit higher, say 600 euros per month? It's a fair price considering the amenities and the central location. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That's too high for me.

While 550 euros is lower than my initial offer, I understand the importance of finding a balance that works for both of us. As a landlord, I'm willing to make some concessions.

I agree to the price of 575 euros per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Excellent! I'm glad we could reach an agreement, Farhad. The apartment is indeed a great find for a student. It's close to the university and all the amenities you might need. I'm sure you'll be very comfortable here. Once the lease is ready, we'll discuss the terms and conditions, including any deposit or additional costs.
