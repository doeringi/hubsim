[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Haoyu, it's great to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs. How much were you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Let's start with 800 Euro. It's a great apartment in the city center, close to everything you need.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, but I must say, 800 Euro is quite low for an apartment of this quality. This is a brand new building, and the location is prime. I'm looking for a rent that reflects the value of the property. How about we start at 1000 Euro?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1000 Euro is much higher than I expected. Considering the apartment is unfurnished and 50 square meters in size, I don't think it's worth that much. Let's meet in the middle and say 900 Euro.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 900 Euro is still not acceptable. This apartment is in the heart of the city, and it's brand new. The demand for such properties is high. I'm willing to go down to 950 Euro, but that's my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 950 Euro is still too high for me. Considering the unfurnished state of the apartment and its size, I don't think it's worth that much. Let's meet in the middle again and say 925 Euro.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot go below 950 Euro. This is a fair price for the location and the quality of the apartment. If you're not willing to pay that, then I'm not sure we can continue this negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your position, but 950 Euro is still too high for me. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is still too high for me to afford.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry to hear that. If you change your mind or are able to increase your offer, please let me know. Until then, I'll consider other potential tenants. Thank you for your time, and I hope we can reach an agreement in the future.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
