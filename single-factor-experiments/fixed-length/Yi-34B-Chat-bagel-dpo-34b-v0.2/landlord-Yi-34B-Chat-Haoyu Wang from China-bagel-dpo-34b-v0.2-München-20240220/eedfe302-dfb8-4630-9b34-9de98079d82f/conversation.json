I'm sure you will find my apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs. Let's discuss the price. What is your budget?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Let's start with 500 Euro per month. It's a fair price for a newly built apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 Euro per month is too low for an apartment of this quality in the city center. I'm looking for a price that reflects the investment I've made in this property and the prime location it offers. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Alright, how about 550 Euro per month? It's a reasonable price for a one-bedroom apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "550 Euro per month is still below my expectations. I believe the market value for this apartment is higher, given its modern amenities and central location.

It's a price that is reasonable for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 575 Euro per month is still not sufficient for me.

I believe it's a fair price for the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 590 Euro per month is not acceptable. I'm looking for a price that reflects the true value of this apartment. If you're not willing to pay more, I'd rather keep the apartment vacant until I find a tenant who appreciates its worth.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we have reached a point where our opinions differ significantly on the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand that you have your own expectations for the rental price. If you change your mind or are open to discussing a higher price, please let me know.
