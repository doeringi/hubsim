I was thinking of 500 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 Euro per month is much lower than my expectations. I'm looking for a price closer to 900 Euro per month. Is that something you can consider?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your pricing. However, as a student, I am on a tight budget. I propose 600 Euro per month. This should be a fair deal for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "600 Euro per month is still below my asking price.
