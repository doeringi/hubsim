I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much are you willing to pay for this prime location in the city center?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "To begin with, I am a student so I would like to pay as low as possible. I would say 300 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's far below my asking price. I'm looking for a fair market value that reflects the quality of the apartment and its location. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Surely, I can increase my offer. How about 350 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "While 350 euros is more in line with what I'm expecting, I still believe the apartment deserves a higher price considering the amenities and the central location.

Would you be willing to go up to 450 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Unfortunately, I cannot afford 450 euros per month. That is too high for me.
