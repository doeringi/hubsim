[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be in an excellent location, with all the amenities you could need within easy reach. How much are you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student and I am looking for a place that is not too expensive. How about 300 EUR per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 300 EUR per month is much lower than my expectations. I'm looking to rent out this apartment for a price that reflects its quality and location. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point. Let's try 350 EUR per month. I think it's a fair price for a student like me.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "350 EUR per month is still quite low for the area and the standard of the apartment.

How about we split the difference and go for 425 EUR per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hmm, 425 EUR per month is better, but still not quite what I'm looking for. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a rent that covers my expenses and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Would you be willing to go up to 440 EUR per month? This would be the lowest I would accept.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I cannot afford the rental price you are suggesting.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand that you may not be able to afford the rental price I'm suggesting.
