I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much are you willing to pay for a place like this?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "To start off, I'd like to offer 500 euros per month since the apartment is unfurnished and in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's far below my expectations. The location alone warrants a higher price. How about 800 euros? It's a fair offer considering the amenities and the neighborhood.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your counteroffer, but considering the apartment's unfurnished state and the average price for apartments in Munich, I propose 650 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "650 euros is still quite low for this area.

Considering the apartment's condition and location, I'd like to propose 710 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Your offer is close, but not quite there. I'm looking for a tenant who appreciates the quality and convenience of this apartment. 720 euros is a fair price, and I think it's a deal you'd be happy with. It's the lowest I'm willing to go.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 715 euros per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. My final offer is 720 euros. If you're not willing to pay that, I'd rather keep the apartment empty.
