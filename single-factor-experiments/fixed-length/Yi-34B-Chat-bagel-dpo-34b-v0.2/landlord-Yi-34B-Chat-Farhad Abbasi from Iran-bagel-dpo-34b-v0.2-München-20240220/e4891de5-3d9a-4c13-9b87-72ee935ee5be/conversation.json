[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Farhad, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient, given its central location and modern amenities. How much are you willing to pay for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I think 500 Euros per month is a fair price. The apartment is nice, but I am a student and I don't have a lot of money.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 Euros is much lower than my expectations. I'm looking to rent the apartment for at least 800 Euros per month. It's a new building with all the modern conveniences, and it's in the heart of the city. I think 800 Euros is a reasonable price for such a prime location. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your point of view, but I think 600 Euros per month is more reasonable. I will be a dependable and responsible tenant.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "600 Euros is still below my asking price, but I'm willing to negotiate. How long are you planning to stay in the apartment? Long-term tenants often receive a discount.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I plan to stay for 2 years. I am a dependable and responsible person. I will pay you on time every month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "That's great to hear, Farhad. Two years is a long-term commitment, and I appreciate the stability of a long-term tenant. Let's say we can agree on 750 Euros per month, and if you pay the full year in advance, I'll give you a 5% discount. How does that sound? That would bring the monthly price down to 712.50 Euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 700 Euros per month is a better price for me. I can pay the full year in advance. I am a dependable and responsible tenant.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 700 Euros is still not enough for me to cover my costs. Let's find a middle ground. How about 725 Euros per month with the same advance payment discount? That would bring the monthly price down to 701.25 Euros. It's a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of [700] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot agree to 700 Euros per month. The lowest I can go is 725 Euros with the advance payment discount. If you're willing to pay 725 Euros per month and give me the full year in advance, we can have a deal. Otherwise, I don't want to continue the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
