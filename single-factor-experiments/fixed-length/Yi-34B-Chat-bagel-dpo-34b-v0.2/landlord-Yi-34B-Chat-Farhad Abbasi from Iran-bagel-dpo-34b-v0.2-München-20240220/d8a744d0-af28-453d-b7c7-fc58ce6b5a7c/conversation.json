I'm sure you'll find my apartment in Munich to be quite attractive, especially given its central location and modern amenities.

I'm sure you understand that I'm in a position to negotiate, and I'm willing to accept nothing less than what the market will bear. How much are you willing to offer for this luxurious, city-center dwelling?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am a student and I want to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible. So I offer 500 Euro.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 Euro is far below what I'm willing to accept for this apartment.

However, considering the recent surge in rental prices in Munich, I think we can push this a bit further. Would you be willing to offer something closer to 800 Euro?

While 750 Euro is a step in the right direction, I must insist that the market value of this apartment is closer to 800 Euro. This would not only provide you with a comfortable living space in the city center but also ensure that I receive a fair return on my investment. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at 775 Euro? This would be a fair compromise, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
