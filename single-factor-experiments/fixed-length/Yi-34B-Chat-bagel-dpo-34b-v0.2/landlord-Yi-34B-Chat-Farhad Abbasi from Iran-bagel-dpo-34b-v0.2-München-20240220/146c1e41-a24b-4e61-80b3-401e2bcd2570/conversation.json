[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Abbasi, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I'm sure you'll find it to be a great place to live, given its prime location in the city center. So, what do you think a fair price would be for this 50-square-meter gem?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your apartment is really nice, but the average price for a 50 square meter apartment in Munich is around \u20ac1200 per month. I think you can give me a better price because I am a student. I appreciate the quality of the apartment, but I need a lower price to afford it.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student and may have budget constraints. However, I have to maintain a certain profit margin to cover my expenses. How about we start with \u20ac1250 per month? This is already a slightly reduced rate considering the market value and the prime location. Would this be a price you could consider?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, but I think we can find a better price. I have seen other apartments in the city center with the same size, but they are cheaper.

I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle. How about \u20ac1200 per month? This is a fair price that reflects the quality of the apartment and its location. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for meeting me halfway. I really appreciate it. I agree to the price of \u20ac1150 per month.

I have a question about the deposit. How much deposit do you require?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Ah, the deposit. A crucial aspect of any rental agreement. For this apartment, I typically require a deposit of one month's rent, which would be \u20ac1150. This is to ensure that the apartment is returned in good condition at the end of the lease. Is this a sum you can provide?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
