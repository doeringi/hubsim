[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Abbasi, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you will find my apartment quite appealing, especially given its prime location in the city center. Let's discuss the rental price. How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I would say 500 Euros per month. This is a very reasonable price for a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 Euros is much lower than the market value for an apartment of this quality and location. I'm looking for a price that reflects the high demand for such properties in the city center. Let's negotiate a bit higher. How about 750 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we are too far apart in our initial offers. I offered 500 Euros, and you came back with 750 Euros. This is too big of a gap to narrow down quickly.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Mr. Abbasi. However, I'm confident that the apartment's location and amenities justify a higher price. If you're not willing to consider a price closer to 750 Euros, then I'm afraid we may not be able to reach an agreement. Is there anything else I can provide you with to help you reconsider?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I would say 550 Euros per month. This is a more reasonable price that takes into account the location and amenities of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "550 Euros is still below my expectations, but I'm willing to listen to your reasoning. Why do you believe this is a fair price for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I think 550 Euros per month is a fair price because it is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is close to all important facilities such as supermarkets, public transportation, etc. \n\nLet me also remind you that I am a smart, dependable, and responsible student. I always follow moral and ethical standards. I want to be on good terms with my landlord. Therefore, I believe 550 Euros per month is a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Your qualifications and character are certainly impressive, Mr. Abbasi. However, the rental price for this apartment is non-negotiable based on its location and recent construction. I must insist on 750 Euros per month to ensure a fair return on my investment. If you're unable to meet this price, I'm afraid we won't be able to proceed with the lease.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 700 Euros per month. This is a good compromise between our initial offers, and it reflects the quality and location of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm pleased to hear that you're willing to meet me halfway, Mr. Abbasi. 700 Euros per month is indeed a fair price for this apartment.
