[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello, Mr. Abbasi. It's a pleasure to have you here. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite appealing, given its central location and modern amenities. Shall we discuss the rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds great, Mr. Schmidt. Let's start with the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Wonderful. I'm sure we can reach an agreement that suits both our needs. How much were you considering for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Mr. Schmidt, I am a student and I am looking for a place with the lowest price possible. Since the apartment is unfurnished and in the city center, I was thinking around 600 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your budgetary concerns, Mr. Abbasi. However, the price you've mentioned is quite low for an unfurnished apartment in the city center. The location and the amenities provided do command a higher price. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, Mr. Schmidt. However, I am a smart and responsible student who can maintain the apartment well. I am also dependable and will not cause any trouble. Since the apartment is newly built, I expect it to be energy-efficient, which could offset the higher cost. I am willing to increase my offer to 650 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, Mr. Abbasi. While your offer of 650 Euros is closer to my expectations, I must emphasize that the apartment's location and the recent construction make it quite desirable. Would you be willing to go a bit higher? Perhaps 700 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your consideration, Mr. Schmidt. However, as a student, I have a limited budget. I agree to the price of 680 Euros per month. I believe it is a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Your offer of 680 Euros per month is indeed more aligned with the value of the apartment. However, given the prime location and the recent construction, I was hoping for a slightly higher rent. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and offer 695 Euros per month? This would reflect the quality and convenience of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your perspective, Mr. Schmidt. However, as a student, I have a limited budget. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe 680 Euros per month is a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I respect your decision, Mr. Abbasi. If you are firm on 680 Euros per month, we can agree to that price. 'I agree to the price of 680 Euros!' Please let me know if you would like to proceed with the lease agreement at this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
