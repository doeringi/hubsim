However, considering the prime location and the quality of the apartment, 400 euros per month might not be sufficient for me. Is there any room for negotiation?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Yes, there is room for negotiation. Considering the apartment is unfurnished and I would need to buy furniture, I would like to keep the rent low. Therefore, I would propose 450 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, your offer of 450 euros per month is still below my expectations.
