I'm sure you'll find my apartment to be quite attractive, especially given its central location and modern amenities.

It's a fair price for an unfurnished apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 Euro per month is not high enough for an apartment of this quality. I believe the market value is significantly higher, especially considering the prime location and the recent construction. Would you be willing to reconsider your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point. However, I'm a student and I have a limited budget. How about 550 Euro per month? It's a reasonable price for an unfurnished apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "550 Euro per month is still below what I believe the apartment is worth. I'm looking for a price that reflects the investment I've made in this property and the convenience it offers to tenants.
