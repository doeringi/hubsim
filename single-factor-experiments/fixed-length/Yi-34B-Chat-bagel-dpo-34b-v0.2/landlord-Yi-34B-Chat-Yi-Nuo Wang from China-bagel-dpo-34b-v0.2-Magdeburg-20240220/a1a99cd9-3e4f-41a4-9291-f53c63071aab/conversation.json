[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient. How much were you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am a student, so I am looking for the lowest possible price. I would say 300 Euro per month would be a good start.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "300 Euro per month is quite low for an apartment of this quality in the city center. I'm sure you understand that I need to cover my expenses and make a reasonable profit. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understandable. How about 350 Euro per month? That should cover most of my expenses as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "350 Euro per month is more in line with what I was expecting. However, considering the high demand for apartments in the city center, I might be able to accept a slightly lower price if you are willing to sign a longer lease term. Would you be interested in a two-year contract?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I see. A two-year contract sounds reasonable. Since the apartment is unfurnished, I would prefer to rent it for a bit cheaper. How about 380 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "380 Euro per month for an unfurnished apartment with a two-year contract is an offer I can consider. However, I must stress that this price is already very close to my asking price. Would you be willing to negotiate a bit more?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood. Let's go back to 350 Euro per month. Since the apartment is close to all important facilities, I think this price is fair.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 350 Euro per month is too low for an unfurnished apartment in the city center with all the amenities it offers. I can't accept that price. Would you be willing to increase your offer to 375 Euro per month? This would be a fair deal for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of [375] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm glad to hear that, Yi-Nuo. We have a deal at 375 Euro per month. Please sign the lease, and we can proceed with the rental agreement. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
