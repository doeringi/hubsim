I'm sure you'll find my apartment to be a great investment. So, what price were you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Let's start with 500 euros per month. It's a fair price for a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, isn't it?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "500 euros per month is not enough for such a prime location.

This should be a good price for both parties, right?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "550 euros is a bit more reasonable, but I'm looking for a tenant who values the quality and location of the apartment.

That's as high as I can go.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "590 euros per month is getting closer, but I'm still not convinced it's the best offer I can get.
