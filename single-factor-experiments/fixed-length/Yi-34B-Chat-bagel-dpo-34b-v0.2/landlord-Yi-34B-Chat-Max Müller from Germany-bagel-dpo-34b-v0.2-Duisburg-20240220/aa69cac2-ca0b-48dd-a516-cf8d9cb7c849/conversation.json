[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a great investment. Let's start with the rental price. How much do you think is fair for this property?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I think a fair price for the apartment would be 500 Euro. It is a newly built, unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It is close to all important facilities. So, 500 Euro would be a good price in my opinion.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Max, but I cannot agree to that price. The apartment is in high demand due to its prime location and modern amenities. I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value. How about we start negotiations at 700 Euro?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That's a significant difference. I understand that the apartment is in high demand and has modern amenities. However, I am a student and my budget is limited. I am willing to increase my offer, but 700 Euro is too high for me. How about 600 Euro?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "600 Euro is still below what I'm looking for, Max. I appreciate your situation as a student, but this apartment is a rare find. The market value is closer to 750 Euro. Would you be willing to go that high?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 750 Euro is still a lot of money for me. I am willing to increase my offer, but I need to think about the long-term affordability. How about we meet in the middle at 675 Euro?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I'm sorry, but I cannot accept 675 Euro. This apartment is unique, and I have other potential tenants who are willing to pay more. I'm looking for a price that reflects its true value, which is closer to 750 Euro. If you're unable to meet that price, I'll have to consider other offers.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Understood, Herr Schmidt. I appreciate your time and understanding of my situation. However, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I cannot afford 750 Euro per month. I hope you find a suitable tenant who can appreciate the apartment's value. 'TERMINATE'", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
