I'm sure you will find my apartment to be a comfortable and convenient place to live.

Considering the size of the apartment and its location, I am willing to pay 400 euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's far below my asking price. I'm looking to get at least 600 euros for this apartment. It's brand new, in the city center, and close to all amenities. Do you think you could increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood, Mr. Schmidt. Considering the factors you mentioned, I am willing to increase my offer to 500 euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "While 500 euros is more in line with what I'm expecting, I still think it could be higher.

Considering my budget and the other apartments available in the area, 575 euros is not a price I am willing to pay.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your position, but let me remind you that this apartment is newly built, unfurnished, and in the city center, which is a prime location. The other apartments you're considering may not match the quality and convenience of this one. Would you reconsider your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Mr. Schmidt, I appreciate your persistence. However, I must decline your offer. 575 euros is not a price I am willing to pay for this apartment.
