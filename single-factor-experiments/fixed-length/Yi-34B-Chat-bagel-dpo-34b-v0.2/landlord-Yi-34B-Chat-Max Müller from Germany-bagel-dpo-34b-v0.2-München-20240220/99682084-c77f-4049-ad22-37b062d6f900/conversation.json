I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a great investment.

It's far too low for the location and the quality of the apartment. I'm looking for a price that reflects the true value of the property. How about 750 euros per month? I think that's a more reasonable offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, but 750 euros is quite high for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment. I am willing to pay 600 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "600 euros is still below my expectations.

This property is in high demand, and I'm looking for a tenant who is willing to pay a fair price. How about we discuss the terms of the lease? Perhaps we can find a solution that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we have not agreed on a rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your frustration, but negotiations often involve a back-and-forth process. If you're not willing to continue discussing the price, then I'm sorry, but we may not be able to reach an agreement.
