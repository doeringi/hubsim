However, for an apartment of this quality, located in the heart of M\u00fcnchen, 600 euros seems a bit low. I'm looking for a price that reflects the high demand for such properties.

This is a brand-new apartment with all the modern amenities, and it's in the most sought-after area of the city. Don't you think it deserves a higher price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the quality of the apartment, but as a student, I have to consider my finances.
