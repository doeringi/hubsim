[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient. Let's discuss the price, shall we? How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I think that 500 euros per month would be a good price. It is in the city center and has all necessary facilities nearby.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 euros per month is much lower than I was expecting. The location and amenities of the apartment warrant a higher price. How about 750 euros per month? That's a fair offer considering the value of the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your justification. However, I am a student and I am on a tight budget. I am willing to pay 600 euros per month. This is a considerable amount for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "600 euros per month is still below my expectations. The apartment is brand new and in a prime location. I'm sure you understand that I need to recoup my investment. How about we meet in the middle at 650 euros per month? It's a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for understanding my situation. I am willing to pay 625 euros per month. This is the highest I can afford.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 625 euros per month is still not acceptable. The apartment is worth much more than that. I'm looking for a tenant who is willing to pay its true value. If you're unable to meet my asking price, I'll have to consider other offers. How about 675 euros per month? It's a very fair offer for such a prime location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, but 675 euros per month is too high for me.

This is the best I can offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "650 euros per month is closer to what I'm looking for, but it's still not quite there. The apartment is in a very sought-after area, and I'm confident I can find a tenant who appreciates its value. How about we split the difference and go with 662.5 euros per month? It's a fair and even amount.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my offer. I am willing to pay 660 euros per month. This is my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "660 euros per month is a step in the right direction, but it's still not quite what I'm seeking. The apartment is in excellent condition and offers a lot of value. I'm sure you can appreciate that. How about 665 euros per month?
