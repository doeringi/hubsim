[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. What price were you thinking of offering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Let's start with 800 Euro per month. It's a fair price for a newly built apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 800 Euro per month is far below my expectations for this property. I'm looking for a rent that reflects the high quality of the apartment and its prime location. Can you offer more?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Okay, how about 850 Euro per month? I believe it's a reasonable price for an unfurnished apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "850 Euro per month is still not what I'm looking for. This apartment is brand new and in the heart of the city, which commands a higher price.

It's a nice round number.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "900 Euro per month is closer to what I had in mind, but I still believe it could be higher. This apartment is in high demand due to its location and amenities. Would you be willing to go a bit higher?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 925 Euro per month is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 925 Euro per month is not enough for me to accept. This apartment is worth more, and I'm certain there are others who are willing to pay a higher rent. If you're not willing to negotiate further, I'll have to consider other potential tenants.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe 925 Euro per month is a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood, Max. If you believe 925 Euro per month is fair, then I'm afraid we cannot proceed with the negotiation. Thank you for your time, and good luck in your search for an apartment.
