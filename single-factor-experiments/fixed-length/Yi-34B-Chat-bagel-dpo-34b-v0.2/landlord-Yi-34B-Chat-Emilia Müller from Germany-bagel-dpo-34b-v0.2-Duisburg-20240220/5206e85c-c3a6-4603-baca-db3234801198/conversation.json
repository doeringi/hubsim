[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

I understand that you're interested in my newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. I'm sure you'll find it to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. So, how much are you willing to pay for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I'm a student so I'm on a tight budget. I was hoping for something around 500 euros a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's much lower than my expectations. I'm looking to get at least 800 euros a month for this apartment. It's a premium location with all the amenities nearby. I'm sure you understand that the value of this property is much higher than your initial offer. Would you be willing to reconsider your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, but 800 euros is a bit high for me. I can go up to 650 euros. I'm a dependable and responsible tenant, and I promise to take good care of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your effort, but 650 euros is still not what I'm looking for. This apartment is in high demand, and I could easily find a tenant who would be willing to pay the full 800 euros. However, I'm willing to negotiate a bit further. How about 750 euros? That's a fair price considering the location and the quality of the apartment. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "750 euros sounds more reasonable. I agree to the price of 750 euros a month!", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. I'm looking for a price closer to 800 euros. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that level. How about 780 euros? That's the lowest I can go. If you're not interested in that price, I'll have to find a tenant who is willing to pay the full asking price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 780 euros is acceptable. I agree to the price of 780 euros a month!", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I'm not willing to accept less than 800 euros for this apartment. It's a premium location with all the amenities nearby, and I believe that's the fair market value. If you're not willing to pay that, I'll have to find a tenant who is. Thank you for your time, but I'll have to terminate this negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the landlord is not willing to go below 800 euros, which is higher than my budget allows.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you may have budget constraints, but the location and quality of the apartment are reflected in the price.
