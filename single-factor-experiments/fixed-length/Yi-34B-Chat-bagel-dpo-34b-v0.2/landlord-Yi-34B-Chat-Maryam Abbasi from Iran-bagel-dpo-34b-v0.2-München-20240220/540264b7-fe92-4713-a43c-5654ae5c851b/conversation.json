I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be in a prime location with all the amenities you need. So, let's discuss the price. How much are you willing to pay for this spacious, unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in the heart of the city?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I think 800 Euro per month is a fair price for this apartment. It's in the city center and has a good size.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 800 Euro per month is not enough for an apartment of this quality in the city center. The location alone warrants a higher price. How about 1000 Euro per month? This is a reasonable offer considering the proximity to public transportation and the convenience of living in the heart of the city. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I disagree. 1000 Euro per month is too much for me. I'm a student and I don't have a lot of money. I think 850 Euro per month is a better price for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student and might have budget constraints. However, the demand for apartments in the city center is high, and the price reflects the desirability of the location. 850 Euro per month is still not sufficient for the value this apartment provides. How about we find a middle ground? Let's say 950 Euro per month. This would be a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I think 950 Euro per month is still too much for me. I can offer 900 Euro per month. This is the highest price I can pay for this apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 900 Euro per month is not enough for this apartment.
