I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. So, what price were you considering for the rental?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Mister Schmidt, I was thinking about 500 Euro per month. It's a fair price for this apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 Euro is too low for this apartment. It's in the city center, and I've received offers higher than that. How about 750 Euro? It's a fair market price for the location and amenities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I hear you, Mister Schmidt. But 750 Euro is too high.

How about we meet in the middle at 675 Euro? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of 675 Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 675 Euro!
