[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

I'm sure you'll find my apartment to be a great place to live. How much are you willing to pay for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "The apartment is nice, but I'm a student so I'm on a tight budget. I was thinking of something around 500 euros a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, 500 euros is a very low offer for such a central location. I'm sure you understand that I need to cover my costs and make a profit. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Of course, I understand that you need to make a profit. But I'm also on a tight budget. How about 600 euros a month? It's a good balance between what I can afford and what you need, I think.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "600 euros is still below my expectations, but I appreciate your effort to reach a middle ground. Would you be willing to go a bit higher? Let's say 650 euros?

It's a fair price for both of us, I think.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 625 euros is still not enough. I need to cover my mortgage and maintenance costs. Would you be willing to go up to 700 euros? This would be more in line with the actual value of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 675 euros a month. It's a good compromise, I think.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "675 euros is closer to what I'm looking for, but it's still not quite there. I'm sorry, but I can't accept that offer. I need to get at least 750 euros a month to make this venture worthwhile.

It's a fair price, I think.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "725 euros is an improvement, but it's still not enough for me to cover my expenses.
