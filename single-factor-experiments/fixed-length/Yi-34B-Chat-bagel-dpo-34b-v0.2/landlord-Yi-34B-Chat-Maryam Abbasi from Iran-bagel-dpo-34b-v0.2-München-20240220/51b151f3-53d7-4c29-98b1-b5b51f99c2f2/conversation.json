However, my apartment is newly built and in the city center, which usually commands a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I must get the best deal for my property. How about we start at 700 Euros per month? This is a fair price considering the location and amenities. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, but it exceeds my budget. I was hoping for something closer to my budget.

However, 575 Euros is still below my asking price of 625 Euros. How about this: I'll reduce the price to 600 Euros per month, and in exchange, you agree to sign a one-year lease and pay the rent upfront for the first month. This will give me some assurance of your commitment, and it's still within your budget.
