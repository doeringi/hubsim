This is a good compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe 475 Euro per month is too high for a student apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your position, but as a landlord, I must consider the market value and my investment.
