[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

I am a student and I want to get the best price possible.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I don't typically provide an initial price. I prefer to let potential tenants make an offer first, so I can assess their budget and negotiate accordingly. How much do you think is a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I understand. I think a fair price for the apartment would be 500 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 Euros per month is much lower than the market value for this apartment. It's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities. A price of 500 Euros would not cover my expenses. I'm looking for a rent that reflects the value of the property. How about you increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I understand your point. However, as a student, I have a limited budget. I am willing to increase my offer to 550 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "550 Euros per month is still quite low for the location and amenities this apartment offers. I appreciate your situation as a student, but I must maintain a fair market price. Let's say the price needs to be at least 700 Euros per month to make it a viable arrangement for both of us. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I understand your position. However, 700 Euros per month is out of my budget. I am willing to increase my offer to 600 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "600 Euros per month is closer to what I'm looking for, but it's still not quite there. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more, considering your situation as a student. How about 650 Euros per month? This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Mr. Schmidt, I understand. I am willing to meet you halfway. I am willing to pay 625 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "625 Euros per month is an improvement, but it's still not quite what I'm looking for. I'm willing to go down to 675 Euros per month, which I believe is a very fair price for this apartment, considering its location and amenities.
