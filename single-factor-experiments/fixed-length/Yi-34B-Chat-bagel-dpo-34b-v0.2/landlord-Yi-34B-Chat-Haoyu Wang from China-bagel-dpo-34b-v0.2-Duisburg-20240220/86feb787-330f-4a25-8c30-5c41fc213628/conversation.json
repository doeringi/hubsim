It's a brand new, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment with all the amenities nearby. I'm looking for a price that reflects the value of the property. How about we start at 800 Euros per month? It's a fair price for the location and the quality of the apartment.

The apartment is in excellent condition and the location is prime. I'm sure you'll appreciate the convenience of living in the city center. How about we meet in the middle at 725 Euros per month?

I'm sorry, but I cannot accept that price. How about we try to find a price that works for both of us? A price that reflects the value of the apartment and your financial situation as a student.
