[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max M\u00fcller, I am pleased to negotiate the price with you. Let's start with a high price. I want at least 2000 Euro for this apartment. Remember, the goal is to get the highest price possible.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your goal, Mister Schmidt. However, I'm looking to pay a fair price for the apartment. Would you consider a lower offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I am always open to negotiations. However, this is a prime location in the city center, and it's newly built. I am looking for a higher price. Let's say, 1900 Euro. Try to match or beat this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1900 Euro is a significant amount, Mister Schmidt. Is there any room for a smaller sum? Perhaps we can find a price that is acceptable to both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, but this apartment is in high demand.

Considering the location and condition of the apartment, 1700 Euro is a good deal. Let's say 1650 Euro. This is my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1650 Euro is getting closer to what I'm looking for. However, as a student, I'm on a tight budget. Can we discuss a price closer to 1500 Euro? I'm sure we can find a middle ground.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, but 1500 Euro is too low for this apartment. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price you are offering is far below the market value of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
