I'm smart, dependable, and responsible, and I'm not easily tricked by other people. I always follow moral and ethical standards, and I want to be on good terms with my landlord. I'm interested in this newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, as it's close to all important facilities.
