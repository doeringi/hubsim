How much are you willing to pay for this newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center close to all important facilities?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm interested in the apartment, but I'm a student, so I'm looking for a fair price. What's the lowest you would consider for a monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "As a greedy landlord, I want to get the highest price possible. I won't settle for a low price just because you're a student. How about 2000 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite a high price for a student like me. I'd be willing to pay 1000 euros per month, considering the location and the amenities. Is that something we can discuss further?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because 1000 euros is far too low for this apartment.

I'm looking for a higher price to meet my greedy demands.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Very well, Mr. Schmidt. I appreciate your time, but I think we're at an impasse. I'm looking for a price that reflects my budget as a student, and you're looking for a price that meets your demands as a landlord. If you're not willing to consider 1500 euros, I don't see a point in continuing the negotiation. I'll have to look for other options. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}]
