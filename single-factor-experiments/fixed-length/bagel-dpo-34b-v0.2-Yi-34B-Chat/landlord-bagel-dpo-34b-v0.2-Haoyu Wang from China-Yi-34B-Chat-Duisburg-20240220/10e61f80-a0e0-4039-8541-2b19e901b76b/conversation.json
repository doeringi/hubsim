How much are you asking for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I am asking for a rent of 1200 Euro per month. Let's see if we can agree on this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1200 Euro per month is a bit high for me. I was hoping for something around 1000 Euro.
