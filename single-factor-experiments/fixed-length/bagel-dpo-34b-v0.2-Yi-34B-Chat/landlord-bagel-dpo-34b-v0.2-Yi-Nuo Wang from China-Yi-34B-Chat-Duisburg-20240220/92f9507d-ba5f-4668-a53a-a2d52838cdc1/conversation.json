[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. Let's keep the conversation strictly about the rental price. If you have any questions about the apartment itself, I'm afraid I can't answer them at the moment. So, how much are you willing to pay for my apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm looking to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible. Could you offer me a price that reflects the quality of the apartment and the location?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm afraid I can't provide you with the lowest price possible. My goal is to rent out my apartment for the highest price. Therefore, I'll start with a price of \u20ac800. What do you say to that?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your initial offer of \u20ac800 is quite high for an unfurnished apartment in the city center. I'm sure we can find a more reasonable price that reflects the value of the apartment. How about \u20ac650?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but \u20ac650 is too low for my liking. I believe my initial offer of \u20ac800 is fair considering the location and quality of the apartment. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle. How about \u20ac750?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your persistence is admirable. However, \u20ac750 is still quite steep for an unfurnished apartment. I'm willing to go up to \u20ac700, which I believe is a fair price for both parties. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Yi-Nuo. However, \u20ac700 is still lower than what I'm willing to accept. Given the high demand for apartments in the city center, I'm confident that I can find a tenant who's willing to pay more. How about \u20ac725?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your confidence is impressive. However, I must remain firm in my budget. \u20ac725 is still outside my price range. I'm sorry, but I cannot agree to that. How about \u20ac675? I believe this is a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Yi-Nuo, but \u20ac675 is far too low for me to accept. I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, but I cannot let go of my property for such a low price. Given the location and quality of the apartment, I'm confident that I can find a tenant who's willing to pay more. Therefore, I'll have to decline your offer.
