I understand that it's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, which is quite attractive due to its proximity to important facilities such as supermarkets and public transportation. I'm looking to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible, while still being on good terms with the landlord. How much are you offering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm aiming for the highest price possible. Let's negotiate.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm here to negotiate the best possible deal for both parties.

However, \u20ac1,100 is still above my budget. I'm hoping to find a price that reflects the unfurnished state of the apartment and the fact that it's a new build. Could we aim for something closer to \u20ac900?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "\u20ac900 is too low for me. I can meet you at \u20ac1,000.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, \u20ac1,000 is more in line with what I was expecting. However, I'm still not sure if this takes into account the lack of furniture and the recent construction. Could we discuss any potential discounts or incentives you might offer to make the apartment more attractive to a student like myself?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "[I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I don't offer discounts or incentives.]", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
