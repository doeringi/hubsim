[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Abbasi, I'm glad you could make it. Let's start with the price. I'm looking for the highest possible rent for this apartment. What is your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm a student, and I'm looking for a fair price. I'm smart and can see through any tricks. I always follow moral and ethical standards. I want to be on good terms with my landlord. How much are you looking for?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Given your status as a student, I expect nothing less than \u20ac1,500 per month. I assure you, the location of the apartment is perfect for a student like you. It's in the city center, close to all important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the location, but \u20ac1,500 is quite high. I'm looking for something more in line with what other apartments in the area are renting for. Can we negotiate a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm always open to negotiations, but I must remind you that this is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center.
