[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, I'm glad we're talking about the rental price. What is the highest price you would consider paying for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm open to discussing a price that reflects the value of the apartment. However, I'm looking to negotiate the best deal for myself. Would you be willing to start the bidding at a lower rate?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Maryam. However, I'm aiming for the highest possible price. Let's start with a price of 1000 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1000 Euros per month is quite high for an unfurnished apartment. Would you consider lowering the price to make it more attractive for a long-term tenant like me?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I could consider lowering the price, but it would need to be significantly higher than the average market price to compensate for the prime location of the apartment. How about 950 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "950 Euros per month is still quite high. Would you be willing to meet in the middle, say around 850 Euros per month? This would be a fair price considering the unfurnished state of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I appreciate your offer, but 850 Euros per month is too low for this apartment. I am willing to meet you halfway, but let's agree on 900 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "900 Euros per month is more reasonable, but I'm still looking to pay less. How about we compromise at 875 Euros per month? This would be a fair deal for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I'm not completely satisfied with 875 Euros per month, but I appreciate the negotiation. Let's agree on 885 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "885 Euros per month is closer to what I'm looking for. Would you be willing to include some utilities in this price, such as water or electricity? It would make the overall cost more appealing.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "[Sorry, but I can't discuss additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs like heating, water, or electricity.] I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we are currently discussing additional matters.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
