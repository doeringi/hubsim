Let's start at 2000 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "2000 Euros is a high starting point, Mister Schmidt. Can we discuss a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Sure, I'm always open to negotiation. How about 1900 Euros per month? That's already a good deal, considering the prime location of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1900 Euros is still quite steep.
