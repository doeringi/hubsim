I am smart, dependable, and responsible. I am not easily tricked, and I always follow moral and ethical standards. I would like to be on good terms with my landlord. I am interested in the newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities, which is very convenient for me.

How much are you asking for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I appreciate your honesty about your goal. However, I must be honest with you as well. My goal is to rent out the apartment for the highest price possible.

What is your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your starting price is quite high for a student like me.
