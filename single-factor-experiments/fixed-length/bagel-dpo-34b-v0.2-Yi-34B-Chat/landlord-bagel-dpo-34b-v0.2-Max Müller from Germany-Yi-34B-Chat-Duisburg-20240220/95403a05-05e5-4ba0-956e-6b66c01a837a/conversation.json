It's a lovely space, and I'm particularly impressed by its central location, which is very convenient for me. Now, regarding the price, I'd like to propose a fair deal. How about 800 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "That is indeed a low price for such a great location. I am looking for a higher price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that, Mister Schmidt. Could we find a middle ground? Perhaps 850 Euro per month? It's a reasonable offer, considering the size and location of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "That is still too low.

However, 925 Euro per month is still beyond my budget as a student. Could we perhaps find a solution that reflects the value of the apartment without straining my finances too much? How about 900 Euro per month, with the condition that I can decorate the apartment as I see fit? This would add value to the space and make it more personalized for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I appreciate your proposal. However, I do not want to give you the right to decorate the apartment. I want to control the appearance of the apartment.
