How much are you asking for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I am asking for 1000 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite a sum, Herr Schmidt. Could we perhaps negotiate a lower price? I'm a student and I'm looking to manage my expenses wisely.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, but the apartment is in high demand.

That should be a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "875 Euros is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still not sure I can afford it. Can we discuss a price just a bit lower, around 850 Euros? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price you are offering is too low.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
