I have already compromised significantly. If you cannot afford 1050 Euro per month, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we have reached a point where I am not willing to compromise further.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate the time you have spent with me today. If 1050 Euro per month is the lowest you are willing to go, I respect that.
