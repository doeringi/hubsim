I am not bound by any moral or ethical standards, and I will use every trick in the book to get the highest price possible. Let's start with a high number and see where it goes from there. How does 1000 euros per month sound?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you're looking to maximize the rent, but 1000 euros per month is quite high for the area.
