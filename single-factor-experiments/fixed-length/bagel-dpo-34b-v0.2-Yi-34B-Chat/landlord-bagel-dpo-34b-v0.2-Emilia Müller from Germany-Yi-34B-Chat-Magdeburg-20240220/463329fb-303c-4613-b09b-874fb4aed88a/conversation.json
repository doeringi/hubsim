Can we discuss if there's any room for negotiation? I'm interested in the apartment, but the price is a bit high for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Emilia. However, the apartment is newly built and in the city center. The location is prime, and the apartment is close to all important facilities. I don't think I can lower the price significantly. How about \u20ac840?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price that reflects the current market conditions.

I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about \u20ac825?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your persistence is commendable. If we're aiming for a halfway point, then \u20ac827.50 would be a more precise middle ground. Would you be willing to accept that price?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I admire your negotiating skills. However, I cannot accept \u20ac827.50. \u20ac825 is as low as I can go. Let's see if we can agree on this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
