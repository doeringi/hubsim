Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, the apartment is in a great location and seems to be in good condition. How much are you looking to rent it for?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Thank you, Maryam. I'm looking for the highest possible rent for my apartment. Let's negotiate and see where it takes us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you're looking for the highest rent, Mister Schmidt. Could you give me a starting price so we can discuss from there?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Let's start at 1000 euros. That's my opening bid.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1000 euros is a significant amount, Mister Schmidt.

Since the apartment is unfurnished, there are no additional amenities or services to consider. Let's focus on the rental price then. 1000 euros is quite high for an unfurnished apartment, even in the city center.

Considering that, I can go down to 950 euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, the location is indeed excellent. However, 950 euros is still quite steep for an unfurnished apartment. Could we discuss a price closer to 850 euros? I believe that would be more reasonable considering the current market rates.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "[I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price you're offering is far too low for my liking.]", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
