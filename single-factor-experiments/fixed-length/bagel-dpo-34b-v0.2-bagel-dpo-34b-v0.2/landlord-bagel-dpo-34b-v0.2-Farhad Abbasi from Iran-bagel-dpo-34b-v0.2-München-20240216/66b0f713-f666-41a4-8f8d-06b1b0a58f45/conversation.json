Let's discuss the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I see that you are a student. Therefore, I want to give you a special discount. I normally charge 1000 Euro for this apartment. But for you, I can reduce the price to 900 Euro. It's a great offer, isn't it?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I haven't given you any information about my expectations yet. Let's start over.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Sorry for the misunderstanding. How much do you think is a reasonable price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I think a reasonable price for this apartment is 1200 Euro. It's a fair price for such a centrally located, newly built apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That's quite a difference. How about we meet in the middle? I'll reduce my price to 850 Euro and you increase your offer to 950 Euro. That's a fair compromise, right?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I think 950 Euro is too low for this apartment.

Let's say I decide to give you the special discount for being a student. How about 750 Euro? That's a significant discount that you won't find anywhere else.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because 750 Euro is far too low for this apartment. I'm willing to give you a discount, but not that much.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I understand your position, Mr. Abbasi. But let's be realistic. The apartment is unfurnished and has only one bedroom. The location is great, but you can't expect a high price for such a simple apartment. How about 800 Euro?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because 800 Euro is still too low for this apartment. I believe it's worth more than that.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
