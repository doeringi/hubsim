But I want to know if the apartment has any flaws or issues.\n\nAlso, I want to know if I will have to pay additional fees for utilities or anything else?\n\nI want to be on good terms with my landlord, so I want to make sure that I pay the agreed-upon rental price.\n\nI would like to know if I can negotiate on the rental price later if I decide to stay longer than 1 year.\n\nI would also like to know if there is a parking space available for my car.\n\nFinally, I would like to know if there are any rules or restrictions regarding smoking or pets in the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Hassan Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "Hassan, I understand your concerns and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let me address each of your questions one by one.\n\nFirstly, the apartment is in excellent condition and has no major flaws or issues. However, I do want to inform you that there may be some minor wear and tear over time, which is normal for any rental property.\n\nRegarding utilities, you will be responsible for paying for your own electricity, gas, and water bills. I will provide you with the necessary information on how to set up these utilities and pay for them.\n\nAs for negotiating the rental price, I am open to discussing this with you later on if you decide to stay longer than one year. However, please note that my goal is to maximize my gains from renting this apartment, so I may not be able to offer a lower rental price for an extended stay.\n\nI'm sorry to say that there is no parking space available for your car. However, you may be able to find street parking or park in a nearby parking garage for an additional fee.\n\nFinally, smoking and pets are not allowed in the apartment. This is a non-negotiable rule, as it is important to maintain a clean and healthy living environment for all tenants.\n\nI hope this information is helpful and reassuring for you. If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
