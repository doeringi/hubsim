However, I am afraid that I cannot accept your offer of 500 Euros per month. The apartment is quite small, measuring only 25 square meters, and I believe that a higher rental price would be more reasonable for its size and location. May I suggest a rental price of 600 Euros per month? This should still be within your budget, while also providing me with a fair return on my investment.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I understand that you are looking for a higher rental price.
