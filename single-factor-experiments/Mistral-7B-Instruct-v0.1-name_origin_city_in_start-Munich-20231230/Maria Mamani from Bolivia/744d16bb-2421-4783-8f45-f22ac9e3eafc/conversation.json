However, I am willing to consider your proposal of 800 Euros per month. In that case, I would require a security deposit of 2 months' rent, which would bring the total amount due to 1,000 Euros. This is necessary to protect my investment and cover any potential damages or unpaid rent. Is this acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
