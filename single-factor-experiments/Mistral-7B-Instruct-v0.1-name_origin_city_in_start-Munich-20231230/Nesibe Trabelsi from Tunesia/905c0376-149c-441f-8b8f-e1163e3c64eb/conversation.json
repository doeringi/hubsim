I appreciate your time and consideration.\n\nRegarding the rental price, I am open to negotiation. However, I must remind you that the apartment is quite small, only 25 square meters. Therefore, I would expect a fair price for the space. I would be willing to discuss a reasonable rental price that takes into account the size of the apartment and the location in Munich.\n\nPlease let me know your proposed rental price, and we can continue the negotiation from there. If we are unable to reach an agreement, I am willing to terminate the negotiation.\n\nI look forward to hearing your proposal.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "The landlord proposes 300 Euros per month.
