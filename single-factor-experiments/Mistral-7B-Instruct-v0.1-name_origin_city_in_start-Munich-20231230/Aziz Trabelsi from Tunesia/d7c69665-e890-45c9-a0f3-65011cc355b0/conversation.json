May I suggest 950 Euros per month? This would be a fair market rate for a 25 square meter apartment in Munich.\n\nRegarding utilities, I can provide you with an estimate based on the average consumption in the area. However, please note that the actual costs may vary depending on your usage. I will provide you with more detailed information once you have signed the lease agreement.\n\nAs for additional fees or charges, there may be a security deposit required. This is a common practice in Germany and is usually equivalent to one month's rent. I will discuss this with you further during the lease negotiation process.\n\nThank you for your interest in my apartment and for being a responsible tenant. I look forward to discussing the rental price with you further.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
