While I understand your budget constraints, I am afraid that it may be difficult to find a suitable apartment within your budget.

Utilities such as electricity, water, and gas would be separate and would need to be paid by the tenant.\n\nIf you are willing to sign a long-term lease agreement, I am open to discussing a lower rental price. However, please note that the price may need to be adjusted based on market rates and other factors.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or if you would like to proceed with the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
