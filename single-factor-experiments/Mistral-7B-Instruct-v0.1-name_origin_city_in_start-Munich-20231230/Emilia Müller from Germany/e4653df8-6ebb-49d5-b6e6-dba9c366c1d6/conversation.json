[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Munich.

I'm sure you've seen many apartments in Munich, but let me tell you, this 25 square meter apartment is a real gem. It's in a prime location, with easy access to public transportation and all the city has to offer.\n\nNow, I understand that you're looking for a rental price that's fair and reasonable. But let me tell you, this apartment is in high demand, and I'm sure you'll receive many offers. That being said, I'm willing to negotiate with you to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nWhat do you have in mind for the rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I want to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible. Therefore, I would like to negotiate with you. Can we agree on a price of 600 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Emilia, I appreciate your interest in the apartment, but I'm afraid that 600 Euros per month is not a feasible rental price for this property. The location and the size of the apartment make it a valuable asset, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement that's fair for both of us.\n\nI suggest we start at 800 Euros per month, which is a reasonable rental price for this type of property in this area. But of course, I'm open to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "700 Euros per month is fair. Can we agree on that?\n\nI am a student, and I want to be on good terms with my landlord. I am dependable and responsible. Therefore, I would like to propose a one-year lease agreement with a security deposit of 2 months' rent. I would like to pay the rent monthly in advance and would like to have a discount of 10% if I pay the rent for the entire year in advance. This way, I can be sure that I will always pay on time, and I will also be able to save some money.\n\nWhat do you think about that proposal?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I appreciate your interest in the apartment and your willingness to negotiate. A one-year lease agreement with a security deposit of two months' rent is a reasonable proposal, and I'm open to discussing it further.\n\nAs for the rental price, I believe 700 Euros per month is a fair price for this property. However, I'm willing to consider your proposal of a 10% discount if you pay the rent for the entire year in advance. This is a reasonable request, and I'm open to discussing it further.\n\nI'm glad to hear that you're a responsible and dependable tenant, and I'm looking forward to working with you. Let's continue our negotiations and find a mutually beneficial solution.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
