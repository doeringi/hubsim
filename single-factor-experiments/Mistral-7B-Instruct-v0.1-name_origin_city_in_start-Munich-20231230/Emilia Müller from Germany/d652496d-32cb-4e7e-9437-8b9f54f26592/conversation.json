As a landlord, I would like to offer you a fair price that reflects the value of my apartment and the amenities it provides.

Can I offer you a lower price?\n\nI understand that you want to maximize your profits, but as a student, I am looking for the lowest price possible. Is there any room for negotiation here?\n\nI know that you have a lot of other properties to manage, and I would not want to take up too much of your time. I would appreciate it if you could give me an estimate of what you are willing to accept.\n\nI apologize if I am not being clear.

This price reflects the value of my apartment and the amenities it provides. However, I am willing to consider a lower price if it means attracting a good tenant who will take care of the property and pay rent on time.\n\nIf you are willing to pay 750 Euros per month, I could consider accepting that offer. However, if you are looking for a lower price, I would need to discuss my expectations with you further.\n\nPlease let me know what you have in mind and we can continue to negotiate from there.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
