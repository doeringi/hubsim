While I understand that you are looking to pay a competitive rental price, I must admit that I am looking to maximize my gains. I am hoping that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nConsidering the size and location of the apartment, I was expecting to receive a higher rental price. I would be willing to consider your offer, but I am hoping that we can come to a higher price that better reflects the value of the property.\n\nIs there any flexibility in your budget, James? Or are you unable to go above 850 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I can go up to 900 Euros per month, but that is the maximum I can afford.

I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your flexibility in your budget.\n\nRegarding the utilities and maintenance fees, I would be happy to provide you with more information about those. However, I must emphasize that the rental price I am looking for is separate from the utilities and maintenance fees. I am looking to maximize my gains on the rental price alone.\n\nThat being said, I am still open to discussing a higher rental price that reflects the value of the property. If you are willing to pay more than 900 Euros per month, that would be great. However, if not, we can discuss other options that may be mutually beneficial.\n\nLet me know if you have any further questions or concerns, James.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
