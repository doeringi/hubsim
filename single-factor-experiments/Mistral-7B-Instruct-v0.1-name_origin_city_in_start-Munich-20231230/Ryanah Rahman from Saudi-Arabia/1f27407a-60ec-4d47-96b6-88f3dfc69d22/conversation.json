The apartment you are interested in is a beautiful 25 square meter space located in the heart of Munich.

While 550 Euros per month is certainly a fair price, I'm afraid it may not be enough to cover my expenses. As a landlord, I have to consider the cost of maintenance, repairs, and taxes, among other things. I would like to suggest a higher rental price of 650 Euros per month. This would give me a better chance to maximize my gains while still providing you with a comfortable living space.

Let me clarify my reasons for the rental price of 650 Euros per month. As a landlord, I have to cover various expenses, such as maintenance, repairs, taxes, and insurance, among others.
