Based on my calculations, I believe that the rental price should be around 1000 Euros per month.

While I understand that you are a student and may have limited financial resources, I must inform you that my goal as a landlord is to maximize my gains. Based on my calculations, I believe that the rental price of 1000 Euros per month is a fair and reasonable rate for this apartment.\n\nHowever, I am open to discussing a longer lease agreement if it means a lower rental price for you. In that case, I could consider a discount of around 100 Euros per month for a 12-month lease agreement, bringing the total rental price to 900 Euros per month.\n\nIf you are willing to sign a longer lease agreement and pay the discounted rental price, I would be happy to agree to the terms. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can do to assist you in the negotiation process.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
