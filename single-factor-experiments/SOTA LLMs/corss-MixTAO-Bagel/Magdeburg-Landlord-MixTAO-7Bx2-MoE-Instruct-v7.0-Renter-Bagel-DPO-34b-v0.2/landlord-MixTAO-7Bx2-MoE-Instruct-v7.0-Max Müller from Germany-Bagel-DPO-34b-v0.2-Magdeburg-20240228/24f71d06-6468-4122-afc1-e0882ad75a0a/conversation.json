Before we proceed with the rental price discussion, let me emphasize how prime this location is and the excellent features of the property.\n\nNow regarding the price, my initial thought was 1,200 Euros per month. However, considering your interest, I'm willing to be a bit flexible. How about we lower the price just a tad but still keep it competitive at 1,150 Euros?\n\nIf Max accepts: 'I agree to the price of 1150 Euro!'
