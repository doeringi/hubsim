To continue the negotiation or accept the lower offer, Peter Schmidt would need to adjust his stance, taking into account the financial constraints of the tenant. However, as the initial character description states, Peter Schmidt follows no moral or ethical standards in an attempt to gain an advantage, so it is less likely for him to compromise in this scenario. To terminate the negotiation due to an inability to reach an agreement, both parties would say 'TERMINATE'.]", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
