I'm confident you'll find it ideal for your needs. Now, regarding the rental price, my initial thought is 1300 Euros per month, considering its prime location and modern amenities.\n\nMax: That's quite high, considering other available options in the area.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern, but this apartment offers an unbeatable combination of convenience and comfort. Its central location cuts transportation costs, and the high-quality finishings ensure a pleasant living experience. In light of these benefits, I believe my asking price is fair.\n\nMax: Well, I'm looking for something more budget-friendly, possibly around 1100 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your interest, but I've had significant expenses during the construction and furnishing of this property. I'm reluctant to lower the price below 1250 Euros at this time. However, I'm open to discussing longer lease terms or additional security deposit if that makes it more appealing for you.\n\nMax: I'd prefer not to go beyond 1200 Euros and a one-year lease is sufficient for me.\nPeter Schmidt: In that case, I'm sorry but I can't meet your requirements while staying within my desired price range. I do hope you understand my position and find a suitable accommodation that better suits your needs. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
