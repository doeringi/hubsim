I'm certain you'll find it ideal for your needs. However, let's focus on the rental price as it's a crucial aspect for both parties.\n\nMax: Of course, but I was hoping for something in the lower range due to the current economic situation.\n\nMe: I understand your concern, but as a landlord, I must consider the apartment's value and location, which are prime in this city center. Let's start with 1200 Euros per month as a starting point. What do you think?\n\nMax: That's quite high for my budget, especially when considering the amenities in the vicinity are average at best.\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that, but as I mentioned, the location is a significant factor. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. Could we perhaps negotiate around 1150 Euros? It's still a premium price for an exceptional location.\n\nMax: That's still a bit steep, but I'll consider it if there are no other options available. However, I'd like to see what other properties have to offer before making a decision.\n\nMe: I understand your position, but let me remind you of the apartment's unique selling points. It's newly built, unfurnished, and offers a spacious 50 square meter layout. The central location is unmatched with all necessary facilities at your doorstep.\n\nMax: Those are indeed attractive features, but I'm hesitant to commit without comparing it to similar properties in the area.\n\nAt this point in the negotiation, Max seems unwilling to agree to the landlord's terms. As the landlord, you could try offering a slightly lower price or stressing the unique selling points even more, but the negotiation might 'TERMINATE' without reaching an agreement. \nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
