How about we start with a monthly rent of 1200 Euros? This will ensure you have ample space and comfort while living in the heart of the city.'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is too expensive for me.

However, if your financial situation changes in the future, do feel free to revisit me.'\n\nIn this case, the negotiation didn't result in an agreement due to the significant difference in the proposed rental prices.

Nevertheless, to show some flexibility, I could consider 1050 Euros as a monthly rent. But please keep in mind that this is still a competitive price for such a prime location.'\n\nIn this round, the landlord showed a slight concession by reducing the price but not as much as the tenant had hoped.

The unique features and prime location of this apartment make it a valuable asset that I cannot undervalue.'\n\nIn this case, the landlord did not accept the tenant's offer, still holding firm to the higher rental price despite the tenant's assurances of reliability and responsibility.
