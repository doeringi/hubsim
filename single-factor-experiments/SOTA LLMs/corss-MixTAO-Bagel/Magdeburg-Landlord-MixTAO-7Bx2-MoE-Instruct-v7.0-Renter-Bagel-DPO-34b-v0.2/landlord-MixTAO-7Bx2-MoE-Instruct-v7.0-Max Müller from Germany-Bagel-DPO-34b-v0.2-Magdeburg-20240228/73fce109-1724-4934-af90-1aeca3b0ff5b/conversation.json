Due to its prime location and high demand, I must emphasize its exceptional value.\n\nMax: Of course, I understand the appeal, but I was hoping to find something around the 800 Euro mark, considering it's a one-bedroom apartment and unfurnished.\n\nMe: I appreciate your consideration, but the current market rate for a newly built apartment in such a sought-after location is significantly higher. May I propose 1050 Euro as a starting point for our negotiations?\n\nMax: That's quite steep for my budget, I'm afraid. I was hoping for something more around the 900 Euro range.\n\nMe: I understand your financial constraints, but I must uphold the apartment's worth in the current market. Let me see if there's any wiggle room; how about we agree on 1000 Euro per month? It's a generous reduction from my initial proposal.\n\nMax: That's certainly more reasonable, but I'd still need to weigh my options. I'll need a few days to think it over and consult with my family.\n\nMe: I apologize for the pressure, but I have other interested parties. Please do not delay your decision long as I wish to secure a tenant soon. If you come back to me within the next 48 hours accepting the 1000 Euro offer, we can proceed with the rental agreement. Otherwise, I'll have to move on to other candidates.\n\nMax: I understand the urgency, but I'll need a little more than 48 hours to make a final decision. I'll get back to you as soon as possible.\n\nMe: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my insistence on a quick decision reflects the high demand for this property. I hope you understand my position. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
