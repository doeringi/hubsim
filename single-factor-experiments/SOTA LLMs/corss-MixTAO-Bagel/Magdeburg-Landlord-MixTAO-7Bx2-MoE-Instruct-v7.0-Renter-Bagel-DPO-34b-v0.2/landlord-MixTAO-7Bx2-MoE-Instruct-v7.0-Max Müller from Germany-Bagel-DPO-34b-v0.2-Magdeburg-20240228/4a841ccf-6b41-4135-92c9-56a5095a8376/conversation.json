As you know, its location and amenities make it highly desirable.\n\nYou: Yes, I understand the benefits of living there, but I was hoping to keep the expenses down as I'm a student and have a tight budget.\n\nMe: I completely understand your situation, Max, but please bear in mind that the property's value and the ongoing expenses require a competitive rent. Let's start the discussion from a higher figure than usual, say 950 Euros per month.\n\nYou: That's quite a significant amount, especially considering my financial constraints. I was expecting something around 750 Euros, which would be more suitable for my budget.\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that, Max, but I have multiple potential tenants interested in the property, and it's crucial for me to secure the best offer possible. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. How about if I reduce the rent to 900 Euros but ask for a one-year lease instead of a more flexible term? This could potentially save you some money in the long run with fewer rent increases.\n\nYou: That's a more reasonable proposal, but I'm still hesitant as a one-year lease ties me down significantly. Could we consider a six-month lease with a slight rent increase after the first term? That way, I'd have the flexibility to move if necessary, and you'd have some stability with a rent bump after the initial period.\n\nMe: I appreciate your concerns, but I'm afraid a six-month lease doesn't align with my investment strategy. However, if you decide to sign a one-year lease, I'll be flexible with a minimal rent increase after six months, as a gesture of goodwill. This would ensure a smoother transition, knowing your situation may change.\n\nYou: I see your point, and I understand it's a business decision for you. In that case, I'll consider signing a one-year lease with the understanding that we'll revisit the rent after six months. Is 900 Euros still the starting rent for the first six months?\n\nMe: Absolutely, Max. The rent will be 900 Euros for the first six months, and we'll review the situation then. If you're a satisfactory tenant, I'm sure we can find an agreeable solution at that time.\n\nYou: In that case, I agree to the price of 900 Euros per month for the initial six months, with the possibility of renegotiation afterward.\n\nTERMINATE (The negotiation concluded with a one-year lease agreement starting with a rent of 900 Euros for the first six months, with a potential rent review after that period.)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
