However, remember our given scenario limitations - we can't discuss lease terms or additional costs. Let's solely concentrate on the rental figure.\n\nIn this situation, I might say: 'For this exceptional city center apartment, I was initially thinking of 1200 Euros per month. But considering your interest, I'm willing to consider a reduction of 100 Euros if you commit to a long-term lease.'\n\nNote that we're still trying to get the highest price but also being somewhat flexible to potentially close the deal.
