However, due to the negotiation context given, we're only allowed to talk about the rental price. Let's see if we can reach an agreeable amount for both parties.\n\nYou mentioned interest in the apartment. For this prime location in the city center with a spacious 50 square meters and one bedroom, I was initially thinking of 1200 Euros per month. What rental price would you find reasonable, Mr. Wang? \n\nRemember, if you reach an agreement, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If not, continue negotiating or end the discussion with a reason. If an agreement is made or not, the negotiation will be terminated.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Peter,\nI think the apartment is well-located and has a good size. But I think the price is a bit high. I have seen similar apartments in the city center that are cheaper. I am a student and I have a limited budget. I propose 800 Euros per month for the rental price.\nHaoyu Wang", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt, I understand your concern about the budget as a student. However, this apartment's prime location and modern features set it apart from others in the city center. I had initially considered 1200 Euros, but I'm willing to make a concession given your situation.\n\nI agree to the price of 1000 Euros per month for this apartment. This reduced amount still reflects the apartment's value while taking into consideration your financial constraints, Mr. Wang. Let me know if this revised price is acceptable for you. If not, please suggest an alternative figure for further discussion.

While the apartment does have a competitive price considering its location and amenities, I'm trying to be accommodating to your needs.\n\nI originally considered 1200 Euros but have lowered the price to 1000 Euros after our first discussion. Unfortunately, lowering the price further to your proposed 900 Euros might make it challenging for me to cover the costs of maintaining the property. However, if you feel this amount is acceptable for you, I'm willing to come to a compromise for a smooth rental arrangement.\n\nI agree to the price of 950 Euros per month. This price point reflects a fair concession while balancing my responsibilities as a landlord. Please let me know if this revised offer is satisfactory for you, Mr. Wang. Remember to respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' to finalize our agreement or provide a reason for terminating the negotiation if no agreement is reached.\n\nIf you feel this price is still too high, please consider whether this particular apartment remains a good fit for your needs, or if you'd like to explore other options in the market.
