Given its prime location and the high demand for such a modern and well-equipped unit, I was initially thinking of renting it out for 1200 Euro per month. \n\nYou: That's quite expensive, Mr. Schmidt. May we perhaps consider a lower amount?\n\nMe: I understand your concern, but as a landlord I must ensure that I get the maximum return on my investment. However, considering your interest, I'm willing to reduce the price slightly, but just slightly - how about 1150 Euro per month? \n\nYou: That's still high for my budget. Could we perhaps go down a bit further?\n\nMe: I'm already making a considerable concession, Emilia. But to accommodate your needs, let me see if I can lower it even more - 1100 Euro per month - but this is my absolute final offer. \n\nYou: That's closer to what I can afford, but I'll need to think about it and discuss with my family. Let me get back to you after the weekend. \n\nMe: Very well, Emilia. I'll look forward to your decision. However, please remember this price of 1100 Euro is final and non-negotiable if you choose to proceed.
