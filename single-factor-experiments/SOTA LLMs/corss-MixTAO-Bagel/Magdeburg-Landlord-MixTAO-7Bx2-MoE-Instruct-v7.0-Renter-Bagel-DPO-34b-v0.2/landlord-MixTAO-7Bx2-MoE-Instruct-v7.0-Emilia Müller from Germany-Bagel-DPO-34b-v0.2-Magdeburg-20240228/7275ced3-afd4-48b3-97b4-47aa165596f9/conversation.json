However, let's focus on the rental price negotiation. To start, I have in mind an initial price that is slightly higher than the average market rate for this superb location and apartment.\n\nAs the negotiation proceeds, I'll attempt to push for the maximum amount I desire while maintaining a facade of flexibility. Keep in mind that the conversation will only revolve around the rental price, and I won't agree to a price below a certain threshold I have in mind. If the negotiation doesn't align with my target, I'll terminate the discussion. However, if we reach an agreement that suits my goals, I'll declare 'I agree to the price of [desired amount] Euro!' and the negotiation will end as well.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I see. Well, I know the market price for an apartment like this is around 600 euros, but to be honest, I would like to pay around 550 euros. I think that would be a good compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my initial target price is significantly higher due to the apartment's prime location and features.
