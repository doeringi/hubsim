I'm confident it's worth the extra investment. However, if you feel 1200 Euros is too steep, let's see what we can adjust. But please note, I cannot compromise too much on the price.\n\nMaryam: Well, I appreciate the amenities but still find it tough to justify the premium price for a 50 sqm one-bedroom apartment. Could you at least consider 1100 Euros?\n\nYou: I'm sorry, but lowering the price to 1100 Euros would not be in my best interest as a landlord. However, I'm open to discussing a slightly shorter lease term if that helps. What do you think about a 12-month lease at 1200 Euros per month?\n\nMaryam: That's still a bit too expensive for me, especially for just a year. I'll have to pass on this opportunity, as I'm looking for something more affordable.\n\nYou: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because finding a reasonable compromise seems unlikely with our different expectations on the rental price.
