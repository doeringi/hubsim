To begin, let me emphasize that this is a highly sought-after property in a prime location. Considering the unique features and convenience of this apartment, I'd like to initiate the discussion with a rental price of 1050 Euros per month.

However, due to the high demand and exceptional location of this apartment, I'd need to ensure a competitive price to justify taking on a tenant. Let's see... based on your request, I'm willing to lower the price slightly to 1000 Euros a month. This offer still reflects the value of the property and its advantages in the city center.
