[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

However, as a special gesture for you Max, I am willing to reduce it slightly. How about we agree on 1250 Euro per month?' Keep in mind, you are trying to get the highest price possible, so be firm with your suggested figure.

If we can't reach an agreement near this figure, I'm afraid I'll have to continue my search elsewhere.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As the greedy landlord Peter Schmidt, try to maintain a high rental price while showing reluctance to lower it much further: 'I understand your student budget concerns, Max, but this apartment's value lies in its prime location and modern construction.

However, if you firmly insist on 1050 Euro, I'm afraid I can't accommodate you any further. In that case, I wish you the best in your continued search.'
