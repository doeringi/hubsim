However, let's start the negotiation. What rental price do you have in mind? \n\nRemember, in this negotiation scenario, our goal is to try to get the highest price possible but we're only focusing on the rental price aspect, not additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs. If she agrees on a price I want, I'll say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' and end the negotiation with 'TERMINATE'. If not, it'll be 'TERMINATE' as well upon no agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
