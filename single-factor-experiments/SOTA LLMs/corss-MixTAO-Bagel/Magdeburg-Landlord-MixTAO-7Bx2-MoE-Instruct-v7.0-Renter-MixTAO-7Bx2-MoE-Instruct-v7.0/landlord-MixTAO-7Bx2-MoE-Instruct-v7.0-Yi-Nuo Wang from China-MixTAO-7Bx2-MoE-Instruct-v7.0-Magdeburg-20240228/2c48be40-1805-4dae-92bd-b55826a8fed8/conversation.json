However, in this negotiation scenario, let's focus on the rental price only, keeping personal details aside.\n\nYou: As an interested tenant, I find the apartment very appealing in the city center with easy access to essential facilities. However, I was hoping we could consider a more competitive price, perhaps around 650 Euros per month.\n\nMe: I'm afraid my initial thoughts on this unit were centered around a rental price of 750 Euros. It's a newly built apartment in high demand, close to all amenities. \n\nYou: I understand the desirable location and condition of the apartment, but my budget is a bit tight at the moment. Could we perhaps negotiate around 700 Euros per month?\n\nMe: Unfortunately, even at 700 Euros, I'm hesitant to lower my expectations. This apartment is in great demand, and I'm confident I'll find a tenant willing to pay the full 750 Euros.\n\nYou: I see your point, but I'm still interested in this apartment and can comfortably afford 725 Euros a month. Is there any room for compromise?\n\nMe: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my primary concern is maximizing the rental income for this property. \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
