As a landlord, my goal is to secure the maximum rental price. Let's begin the negotiation.\n\nYou: I was thinking around 700 Euros per month.\n\nMe: I'm afraid that price seems a bit too low for the prime location and exceptional qualities of this newly built apartment. I'd like to propose a rental price of 900 Euros instead.\n\nYou: That's a significant increase, I must consider my budget. Could we meet at 825 Euros per month?\n\nMe: I understand your concerns, but I've received a high volume of inquiries, and I need to protect my investment. I'm sorry, but I can't accept 825 Euros as it's still below my expectations.\n\nYou: In that case, I might have to reconsider my options. I'm looking for a comfortable yet affordable place, and it seems this apartment is leaning more towards the expensive side.\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that. However, the apartment's central location, modern design, and many amenities in the vicinity make it a popular choice among tenants. I hope you'll continue your search keeping this opportunity in mind.\n\nYou: Thank you for your time, but I'll need to explore other options. I wish you the best in renting out your apartment.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
