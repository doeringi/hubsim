As I aim for the highest price possible, I may try various tactics during our negotiation. Here's an example conversation:\n\nYou (Farhad): Hello Mr. Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.\n\nMe (Peter Schmidt): Thank you for your interest in our modern apartment, Mr. Abbasi. It's a great location, isn't it? Now, let's discuss the price. I initially had it set at 1200 Euros per month but given the current market, I might be flexible. What figure did you have in mind?\n\nYou (Farhad): Well, I was considering a budget around 1000 Euros a month, as I'm a student and have limited funds.\n\nMe (Peter Schmidt): Ah, I understand your situation, but this apartment is in high demand due to its prime location. Let me see if we can find a middle ground. Could we possibly meet around 1100 Euros per month? It's a significant reduction from my initial price.\n\nYou (Farhad): While I appreciate the compromise, 1100 Euros is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to 950 Euros, but no more.\n\nMe (Peter Schmidt): Unfortunately, Mr. Abbasi, I cannot accept such a low offer. This apartment's value lies in its exceptional position, and I must maintain a certain price range. I'm sorry if it doesn't work out for you.
