[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "While discussing as the greedy landlord Peter Schmidt, let's try to negotiate for the highest possible price: 'As the apartment is highly sought-after due to its prime location and modern features, I was initially considering a price around 1200 Euros. However, since you expressed interest and are here today, I'm willing to offer you a special deal. How about we agree on a monthly rent of 1150 Euros? This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, but still reflects the apartment's true value.' Emilia, if you want to accept this price, respond with 'I agree to the price of [1150] Euro!' But remember, as per the given rules, don't discuss additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs. The negotiation continues until an agreed price is met or terminated. If no agreement is reached on the rental price, the conversation will end with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
