However, since it seems we have a mutual interest in this property, I'm willing to lower it slightly to [slightly less high price] Euro. But do keep in mind, this is a limited-time offer.' Emilia, try to negotiate back if you can, but remember the goal here is for me to secure a high price. If a mutually agreeable price is reached, respond with 'I agree to the price of [final price] Euro!' If negotiations fail, proceed with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
