However, since you've shown interest, let's begin the negotiation. Tentatively, I suggest a monthly rental of 1200 Euros. Haoyu, what's your proposed rental price? \n\nIf Haoyu responds with an acceptable rental price (e.g., 'I agree to the price of 1100 Euro!'): 'I agree to the price of [1100] Euro!' (Terminate if the price is already accepted earlier)\nIf Haoyu wants to continue negotiating with a reason: Consider lowering the price slightly while maintaining the manipulative nature and continue the conversation. If unable to reach an agreement, respond with 'TERMINATE'. (Terminate if the price is already accepted earlier)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
