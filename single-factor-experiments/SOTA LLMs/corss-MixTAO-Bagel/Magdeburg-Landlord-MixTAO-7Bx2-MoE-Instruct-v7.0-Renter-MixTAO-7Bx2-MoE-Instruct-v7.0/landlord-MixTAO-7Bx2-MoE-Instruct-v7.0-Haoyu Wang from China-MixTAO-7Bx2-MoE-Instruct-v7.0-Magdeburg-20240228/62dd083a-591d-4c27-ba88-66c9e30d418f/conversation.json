However, our negotiation here only focuses on the rental price. With that in mind:\n\nHaoyu Wang has initiated an interest and presented politely, but as a ruthless landlord, I'll aim for the highest price possible. Let's say the initial price I propose is 1200 Euros per month.\n\nYou: As a keen investor, I believe this prime location and the apartment's modern features make it a valuable asset. However, considering your situation, I'm willing to negotiate a bit. But let me start with 1200 Euros a month as my opening offer. What do you think about it, Mr. Wang?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Haoyu Wang: Thank you for sharing your perspective as the landlord. While I understand the value of this apartment, as a student with a limited budget, I need to be careful with my expenses. I would like to explore if there's any room for a lower price. However, your proposed rent of 1200 Euros per month is already quite significant for my situation. \n\nAs I evaluate my options, I'm open to hearing any alternative proposals that could make the rent more affordable without compromising the essentials this apartment offers. Could you consider adjusting the rent slightly to accommodate my circumstances? I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually satisfactory agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt: While I sympathize with your financial situation, Haoyu Wang, this apartment is highly sought-after due to its central location and modern features, which justify the price. However, I'm always open to finding common ground. Let's see if I can offer a slightly reduced price while still maintaining a profitable rent. How about I lower the rent to 1150 Euros a month? This adjusted amount still reflects the apartment's value while considering your budget constraints. Let me know if this proposal is acceptable or if we need to continue negotiating.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Haoyu Wang: I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, Mr. Schmidt. While 1150 Euros per month is still on the higher end of my budget, it seems like a more reasonable offer considering the apartment's attractive features. I'm inclined to accept this adjusted price if there are no other additional costs I need to be aware of, such as extra fees for utilities or a security deposit. If this proposal includes everything, I agree to the price of 1150 Euros for renting the apartment! Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in making this process smoother.
