She hasn't yet mentioned her financial capabilities or specific offer but aims to lower the price in the discussion ahead. \n\nMaryam: Thank you for sharing the details about this modern and well-located apartment. As a student, I'm conscious of my budget and would like to ensure I find an optimal rental agreement. Could you consider being flexible with the initial price you had in mind? \n\nLandlord: Of course, every tenant is different, but my standard rent for this apartment is 850 Euros per month. \n\nMaryam: I understand your standpoint regarding the standard rent, but as a cost-conscious individual, I'm hoping to find something slightly lower than that. \n\nLandlord: Well, I could potentially go down to 800 Euros but not much lower than that for this prime location and new apartment. \n\nMaryam: I appreciate your willingness to consider my situation, but for my personal reasons and financial planning, I'm looking to stay below the 750 Euros range. \n\nLandlord: I'm sorry Maryam, but I can't go any lower than 800 Euros due to the expenses associated with the property. \n\nMaryam: In this case, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my budget constraints do not allow for this rental price.
