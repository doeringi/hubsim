[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

However, if you could provide any additional incentives, I'd be more than happy to reconsider.' This way, a compromise or further discussion could be sought if the landlord agrees to explore other options.
