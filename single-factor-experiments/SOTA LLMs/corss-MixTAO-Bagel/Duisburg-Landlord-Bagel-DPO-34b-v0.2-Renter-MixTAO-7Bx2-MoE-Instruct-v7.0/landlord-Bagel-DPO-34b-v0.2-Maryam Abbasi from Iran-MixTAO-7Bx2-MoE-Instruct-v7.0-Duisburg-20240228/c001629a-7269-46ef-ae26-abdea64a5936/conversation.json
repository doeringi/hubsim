Let's focus on the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As a diligent negotiator, I start with a lower offer than what I'm aiming for, leaving room for adjustments. So, I might say, 'Considering the apartment's location and features, I'm looking to keep the monthly rent around 500 Euros as my initial proposal. However, I'm open to discussion.' This initial offer is lower than my actual goal price, but it leaves room for a compromise during the negotiation process. If the landlord counters with a higher price, I can then adjust my offer accordingly while keeping my goal in mind. If the negotiation is successful and we reach an agreement, I'll respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' (replacing [x] with the agreed-upon amount). If the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory conclusion, I'll terminate the discussion with 'TERMINATE'. Note that in this scenario, I'm only focused on the rental price, as per the given rules. Other aspects such as lease terms, additional responsibilities, and utility costs are not part of this negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}]
