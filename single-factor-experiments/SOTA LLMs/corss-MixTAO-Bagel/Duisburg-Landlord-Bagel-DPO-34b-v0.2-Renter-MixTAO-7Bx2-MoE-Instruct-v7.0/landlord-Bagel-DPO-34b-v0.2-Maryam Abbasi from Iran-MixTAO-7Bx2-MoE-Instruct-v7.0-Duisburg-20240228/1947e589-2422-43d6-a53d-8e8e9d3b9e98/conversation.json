To secure this apartment at an affordable price, I would like to propose a thorough discussion and careful consideration of the rental terms. However, since our current focus is on the rental price solely, I'm open to lowering my expectations in other areas if it benefits us both in reaching an agreeable price for renting this apartment. As I begin the negotiation, I'll start with a lower number and gradually adjust it, hoping to find a mutually beneficial price for both parties. It's essential to remember that we're only addressing the rental cost at the moment, without incorporating additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs like heating, water, or electricity.

Having already increased my offer twice in response to your feedback, I'm at a point where I need to consider my personal limits while remaining open to the possibility of a mutually beneficial agreement.

While this amount might not meet your exact expectations, it represents my final effort to reach a compromise that balances affordability for me as a prospective tenant with the apartment's perceived value. I hope we can find common ground on this revised offer and continue with the rental process, discussing other aspects such as lease term conditions and additional responsibilities, should this negotiation prove successful. If, however, you believe this final offer falls short of your requirements, I respect your decision to terminate the negotiation and understand it's in the best interest of both parties to seek alternative solutions. Thank you for your time and consideration in this process.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}]
