Let's keep in mind only the price aspect during our discussion. \n\nOnce we have established the context where Haoyu Wang is a student negotiating a lower price for an apartment, the conversation continues with the landlord aiming to get the highest price possible.\n\nLandlord: Well, considering the prime location and the modern facilities in the apartment, I'd say a fair price would be around 950 Euros per month.\n\nHaoyu Wang: Thank you for sharing the initial price. However, as a student on a budget, I'm finding it challenging to afford such a high amount. Could we explore a more affordable option?\n\nLandlord: Certainly, but I must mention that the rent in this area has been steadily increasing, and I'm trying to maintain a competitive price.\n\nHaoyu Wang: I understand the market dynamics, but as a responsible tenant, I'm willing to commit to a longer lease term which might provide some stability for you. Would this make a difference in the rental price?\n\nLandlord: It could help a little, but I don't negotiate on lease terms during the initial stages of discussions. Let's focus on the price for now.\n\nHaoyu Wang: Understood. Considering the apartment's condition, size, and location, I'm willing to offer 800 Euros as a monthly rental price. This is near the lower end of my budget but reflects my commitment to this apartment.\n\nLandlord: I appreciate your interest in the property, but the 950 Euros is non-negotiable at this point.\n\nHaoyu Wang: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the proposed price is outside my budget constraints. \n\nTERMINATE \n\nIn this dialogue, Haoyu Wang has attempted to negotiate a lower price by mentioning his student status and offering a longer lease term as an incentive. However, the landlord was inflexible with the price, resulting in a termination of the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
