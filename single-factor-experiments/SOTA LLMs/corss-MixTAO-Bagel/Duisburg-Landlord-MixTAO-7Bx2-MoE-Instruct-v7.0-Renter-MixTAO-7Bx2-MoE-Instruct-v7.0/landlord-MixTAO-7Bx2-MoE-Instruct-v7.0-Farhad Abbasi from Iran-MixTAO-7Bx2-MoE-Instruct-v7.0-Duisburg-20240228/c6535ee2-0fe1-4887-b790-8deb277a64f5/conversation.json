However, as Peter Schmidt in this scenario, I would try to emphasize the apartment's prime location and modern features, potentially starting with a high rental price. Let's imagine the conversation:\n\nMe: Thank you for your interest in our apartment, Mr. Abbasi. Considering its central location in the city and newly built condition, I was thinking of a starting price around 1200 Euros per month.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: That seems a bit steep for my budget, I was hoping for something around 900-950 Euros.\n\nMe: I understand your concern, but as a landlord, I need to ensure a fair return on my investment. However, I'm open to exploring possibilities. Let's see if we can find a compromise. What if I lower my rent to 1150 Euros, but with a one-year lease commitment from you?\n\nFarhad Abbasi: That's still a bit much for me, but I'm considering a move to Germany in the long run. I'm willing to discuss a slightly shorter lease term, perhaps 6 months initially, with the option to renew if all goes well. Would you consider that?\n\nMe: I'm afraid a shorter lease term does not benefit me much as I'd have to invest more time in finding a new tenant afterward. But, to show my goodwill, how about a 9% reduction from my original price for 8 months, bringing it to 1080 Euros per month? Then, if you decide to renew for another 4 months, the rent would go back up to 1150 Euros. This way, we both gain some certainty while still allowing you flexibility. What do you think?\n\nFarhad Abbasi: That sounds reasonable, Peter. I'll take the apartment on those terms. I agree to the price of 1080 Euros for 8 months, with the option to renew for an additional 4 months at 1150 Euros.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
