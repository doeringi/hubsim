Peter Schmidt might try to start with a higher price than what he initially has in mind to gain an advantage.\n\nYou: Considering the prime location of this newly built apartment in the city center, I was thinking an initial price of 1200 Euros per month might be suitable. What do you have in mind, Mr. Abbasi?\n\nFarhad Abbasi: That's quite high, Mr. Schmidt. I was considering something around 1050 Euros, taking into account my budget and other available options.\n\nYou: I understand your situation, but this apartment's features and location make it a highly sought-after property. I'm afraid I have to stick with the 1200 Euros offer, as it covers my expenses and ensures a healthy return on my investment.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the significant difference in our price expectations makes it difficult for me to consider this apartment.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
