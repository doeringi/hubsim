I appreciate the initial offer of 1150 Euros, but considering my personal financial situation and the current market trends, I would like to see if we could lower the rent to around 1100 Euros per month while maintaining a long-term lease commitment. If not, I will thoroughly evaluate my alternatives.

Given the current market trends, reducing the rent further to 1100 Euros would not leave me with a suitable return on my investment. However, should you decide to sign a long-term lease of at least three years, I might consider a small concession of 10 Euros per month, bringing the rental price to 1140 Euros. Let's consider this a final offer.' Emilia, see if you can accept this offer or propose further negotiations but remember to try to reach the price of 1140 Euros.
