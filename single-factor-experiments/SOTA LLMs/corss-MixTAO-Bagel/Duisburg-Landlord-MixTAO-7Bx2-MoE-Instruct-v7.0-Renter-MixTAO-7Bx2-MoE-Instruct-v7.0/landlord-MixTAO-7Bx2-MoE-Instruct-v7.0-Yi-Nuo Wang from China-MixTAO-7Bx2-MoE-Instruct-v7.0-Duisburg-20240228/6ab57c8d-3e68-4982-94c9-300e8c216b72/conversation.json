Peter Schmidt might start with a high initial price and try to reduce your counteroffers, aiming to maximize his earnings.\n\nYou: I'm interested in the apartment but have a tight budget. Could we consider a lower rental price?\n\nPeter Schmidt: Unfortunately, I have several other interested parties, so I must maintain a competitive rate. The initial price I had in mind was 1200 Euros per month.\n\nYou: That's a bit steep for me. Would something around 1000 Euros work for you?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I need to ensure a maximum return on my investment.\n\nIn this scenario, Peter Schmidt prioritizes his own financial gain over a potential agreement with the tenant. However, remember that in reality, he would not be able to disclose his unethical traits or intentions during a real negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "To continue the negotiation with Peter Schmidt while maintaining your goal of a lower rental price, you can try the following approach:\n\nYou: I'm sorry to hear that. As a student, I value affordability and have a fixed budget. Could we perhaps find a middle ground around 1100 Euros per month? It would be a significant compromise for me, but I'm confident I can manage it responsibly.\n\nPeter Schmidt: Let me think about it... Although I prefer the initial price, your honesty and dependability are appealing traits. I'll consider your proposal, but it would be a concession on my part. How about we meet halfway at 1150 Euros per month?\n\nYou: I appreciate your understanding and flexibility. I agree to the price of 1150 Euros! \n\nTERMINATE \n\nIn this revised scenario, you managed to find a compromise with Peter Schmidt by emphasizing your financial constraints while also highlighting your trustworthiness. You were able to reach a price slightly higher than your original preference but lower than his initial offer. This demonstrates the importance of communication and finding common ground during negotiations. However, it's essential to remember that these fictional interactions are not a reflection of real-life situations and behaviors.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
