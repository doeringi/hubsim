Let's focus on the rental price for now.\n\nMax: Of course, I was thinking around 750 Euros per month, considering its central location and size.\n\nMe: I appreciate your interest, but due to its high demand and exceptional features, I've received other offers close to 900 Euros.\n\nMax: I see, but this apartment is a bit smaller and less furnished compared to some others in the area. I'd be willing to go up to 800 Euros, but not more.\n\nMe: Mr. M\u00fcller, I regret to say that at 800 Euros, I'm still receiving better proposals. To secure this apartment, I'm afraid I'd need at least 850 Euros, ideally closer to 900.\n\nMax: Peter, I'm sorry but I can't go beyond 825 Euros. I believe there could be someone more flexible out there who would appreciate this apartment at a fairer price.\n\nMe: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm determined to find a tenant who understands the true value of this property.
