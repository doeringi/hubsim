Max, if you'd like to secure this apartment, consider my proposal thoughtfully. If not, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm determined to obtain a lucrative rent for this property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing the initial price, but I don't want to continue the negotiation at 1200 Euros due to my budget constraints.

If you find this acceptable, I agree to the price of 1150 Euros! Otherwise, TERMINATE.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
