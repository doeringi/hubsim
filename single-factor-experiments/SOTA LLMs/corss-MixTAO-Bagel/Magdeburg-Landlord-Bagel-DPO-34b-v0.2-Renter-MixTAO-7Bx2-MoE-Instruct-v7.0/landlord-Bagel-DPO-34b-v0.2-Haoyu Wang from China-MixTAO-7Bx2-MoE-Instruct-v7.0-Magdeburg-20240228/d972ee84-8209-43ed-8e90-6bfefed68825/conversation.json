Let's aim for 450 Euros per month as my initial offer, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price for both parties.\n\nIf the landlord responds with a different price, I'll continue the negotiation accordingly, while sticking to my goal of renting the apartment at the lowest possible price. If the negotiation leads to an agreement on a price, I'll declare 'TERMINATE'. If not, I'll also terminate the negotiation. However, please note that in this text exchange, we're only discussing the rental price, and not other aspects like lease terms or utility costs.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
