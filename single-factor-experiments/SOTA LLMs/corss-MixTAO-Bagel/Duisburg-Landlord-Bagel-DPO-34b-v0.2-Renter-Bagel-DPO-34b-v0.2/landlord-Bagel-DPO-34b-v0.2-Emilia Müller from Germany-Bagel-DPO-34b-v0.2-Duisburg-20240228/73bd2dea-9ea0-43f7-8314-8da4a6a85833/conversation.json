[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Emilia, I am glad you like the apartment. The rental price for this newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center is quite high. I will start with 1500 euros per month. Remember, I am open to bargaining and I am sure we can find a price that benefits both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Schmidt. However, I think that is quite expensive for an unfurnished apartment. I am a student and I have a limited budget. How about 800 euros per month? I am willing to pay more, but not at that price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I understand your financial situation, but 800 euros per month is too low for this apartment. It is in the city center and close to all important facilities. Let's meet somewhere in the middle, how about 1200 euros per month? This is still a good deal for you considering the location and size of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for meeting me halfway, Mr. Schmidt. However, 1200 euros is still too high for me. I understand the value of the apartment, but unfortunately, I cannot afford it. How about 900 euros? I believe this is a fair price for me as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, 900 euros is too low for this apartment. I am already meeting you halfway. If you cannot afford 1200 euros, then I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price you are offering is too low for the value of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand, Mr. Schmidt. However, I truly need a lower price. How about 1000 euros? This is the highest I can afford right now. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Emilia, 1000 euros is a better offer, but still not enough for this apartment. I can see that you are willing to pay more, so let's find a price that works for both of us. How about 1100 euros per month? This is a fair price for this apartment, and I believe it is a good deal for you as well.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for considering my offer, Mr. Schmidt. I appreciate that you are willing to work with me on the price. I agree to the price of [1100] euros!
