Thank you for your understanding throughout the negotiation process. 'TERMINATE' Now, the negotiation is concluded with the rental price set at 950 Euros per month. In this context, both parties have worked towards an agreement while considering their respective interests and constraints. The landlord, while being initially greedy and persistent with a high rental price, eventually showed flexibility to accommodate the tenant's financial situation while still maintaining a decent income from the property. The tenant, on the other hand, has demonstrated a balanced approach of seeking a fair price without pushing too far beyond their budget limits. The outcome reflects a successful interaction between the two parties in a competitive real estate market.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
