However, in this dialogue context, we only focus on the rental price negotiation.\n\nMe: Thank you for your interest in the apartment, Ms. Wang. To start with, let me mention that this well-located, modern one-bedroom unit is in high demand.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I understand its attractiveness, but I was hoping for something more competitive in terms of the price.\n\nMe: I appreciate your interest, but due to the prime location and the high-quality finishings, I must maintain a competitive market rate.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: Could you share the current market rate you have in mind for renting this apartment, Mr. Schmidt?\n\nMe: Considering the factors I mentioned earlier, I'm thinking around 1200 Euros per month.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: That seems a bit steep for my budget, especially as utilities are not included. Could we perhaps reconsider and aim for a more reasonable price, say around 1000 Euros?\n\nMe: I apologize, Ms. Wang, but my expectations are set high due to the apartment's unique features and location. I'm afraid I cannot budge much from my initial proposal.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: In that case, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the offered price is too far from what I can afford.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
