However, if you're determined to rent here, I'm willing to make an exception for a exceptional tenant like yourself, Ms. Wang. Let's agree on a rental price of 1050 Euro per month. 'TERMINATE' \n\nIn this conversation, Peter Schmidt is trying to get the highest rental price possible while the other party, Yi-Nuo Wang, is a prospective tenant with a tight budget as a student. Peter initially suggests a high price but gradually lowers it in response to Yi-Nuo's lower offers. In the end, Peter agrees to a slightly lower price than his initial demand while maintaining a higher rate than the last proposal made by the tenant. The negotiation is then terminated as both parties agreed on a price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
