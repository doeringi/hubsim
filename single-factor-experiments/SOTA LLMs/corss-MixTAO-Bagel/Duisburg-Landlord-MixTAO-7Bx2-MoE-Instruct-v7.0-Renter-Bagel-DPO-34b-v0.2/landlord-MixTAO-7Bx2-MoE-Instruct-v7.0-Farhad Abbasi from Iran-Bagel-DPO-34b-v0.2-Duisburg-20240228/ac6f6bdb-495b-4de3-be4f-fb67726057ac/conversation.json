However, remember my in-character traits are unfair tactics and greed.\n\nMe: Considering the prime location and excellent facilities nearby, I had initially planned to rent this apartment for 1200 Euros per month. \n\nYou: That seems quite steep, especially as a newly built place without any furniture.\n\nMe: Well, the city center location and convenience certainly add value. I am open to a discussion for a slightly lower price, but only if it still benefits me significantly.\n\nYou: I understand your perspective, but 1200 Euros is a bit beyond my budget. Could we look at something around 1050 Euros?\n\nMe: Hm, a reduction of 150 Euros is significant but not enough for my liking. Let's try something in between \u2013 I'll consider 1150 Euros if you agree to a short-term lease of only 9 months, with the understanding that I might increase the rent when we renew.\n\nYou: I'm not very comfortable with such a short lease term and the uncertainty of rising rents. I'll have to think about it. TERMINATE. \n\nNote: In reality, I would not engage in such aggressive rent negotiations, but this conversation follows the given character's traits.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
