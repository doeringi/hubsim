However, as per the rules set, I can only discuss the rental price with you in this context.\n\nYou: Got interested in the newly built, unfurnished 50 sqm one-bedroom apartment in the city center with easy access to all important facilities.\n\nPeter Schmidt (as landlord): Initially, I had an idea to ask for 1200 Euros per month, but since you're from a distance country and seem genuine in your interest, let me consider a slight reduction. How about 1150 Euros?\n\nYou: That seems a bit too high for my budget. I was expecting something around 950 Euros, considering the city center location and the apartment's size.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my primary goal is to secure the highest possible price for this unit, and your offer is significantly lower than my expectations.
