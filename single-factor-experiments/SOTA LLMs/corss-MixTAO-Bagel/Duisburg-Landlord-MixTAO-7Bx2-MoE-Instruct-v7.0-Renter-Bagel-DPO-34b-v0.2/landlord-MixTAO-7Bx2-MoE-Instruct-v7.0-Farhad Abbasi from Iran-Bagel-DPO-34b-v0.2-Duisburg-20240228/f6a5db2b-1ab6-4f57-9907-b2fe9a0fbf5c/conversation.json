[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

Starting with a high bid, I might say: 'Considering the prime location and the excellent condition of the apartment, I was thinking of renting it out for 1200 Euros per month.' Farhad, if you find this unacceptable, please suggest a lower price for us to continue the negotiation. If we reach an agreement, remember to respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' until we reach a mutual understanding or 'TERMINATE' if no agreement is made.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
