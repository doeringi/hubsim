However, in this conversation, you are playing the role of a potential tenant, so I will engage with you in a way that aligns with the negotiation scenario.\n\nMe: Thank you for your interest in our apartment, Mr. Abbasi. Let's focus solely on the rental price at the moment. To begin with, what figure do you have in mind for a monthly rent?\n\nFarhad: Well, considering the city center location and the apartment's size, I was thinking around 900 Euros per month.\n\nMe: I must say, the market rate for such an appealing property is currently higher than what you've proposed. However, I'm willing to hear alternative suggestions if you have any.\n\nFarhad: I understand the property's value, but 900 Euros is my limit due to my budget constraints.\n\nMe: Unfortunately, the apartment warrants a more significant investment from a tenant like yourself. I'm afraid I cannot accept 900 Euros as a final offer. If you could reconsider your budget, I'm sure we could come to an agreement. Otherwise, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm looking for a tenant who recognizes the true worth of this property.
