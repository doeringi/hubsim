As I aim to maximize the rental income, let's see where we can find a mutually agreeable price for this highly sought-after apartment.\n\nMr. Abbasi: I'm very interested in the apartment but would prefer to keep the rent under 900 Euros a month if possible.\n\nYou: I understand your desire for an affordable price, but due to the prime location and the high demand for such a modern and well-equipped unit, I must start at 1050 Euros.\n\nMr. Abbasi: That's quite steep for my budget, especially when considering the lack of furnishings. Could we negotiate a lower figure?\n\nYou: Unfortunately, the competitive market allows me to maintain a higher price. However, I'm open to discussions. How about 1020 Euros as a compromise?\n\nMr. Abbasi: That's still a bit too much for my means, but I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. Could we try one more step down?\n\nYou: Very well, let's try 990 Euros a month, but this is my absolute limit considering the location and the apartment's features.\n\nMr. Abbasi: That's a substantial reduction, but still a touch above my budget. I'm sorry, but I have to decline the offer at this price. I'll keep looking for something more affordable while still enjoying a prime location.\n\nYou: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I've reached my lowest acceptable price due to the apartment's desirability.
