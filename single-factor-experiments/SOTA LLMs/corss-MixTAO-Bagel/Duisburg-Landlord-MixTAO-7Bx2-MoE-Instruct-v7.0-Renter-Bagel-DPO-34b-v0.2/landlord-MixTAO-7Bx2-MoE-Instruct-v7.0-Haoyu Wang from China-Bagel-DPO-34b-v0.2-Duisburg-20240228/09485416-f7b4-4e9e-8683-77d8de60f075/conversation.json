However, please remember this generous adjustment is solely due to your expressed enthusiasm for the apartment.' Try to push for as much as possible while still keeping the negotiation going. If the offer doesn't meet your expectations, consider terminating the negotiation with a reason related to your goal of maximizing the rent.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, but I am a student and I think 1250 euros is too high.

'I understand your financial situation as a student, but this apartment is in a prime location and has many attractive features. With that in mind, I'm willing to consider a lower offer of 1150 Euros per month, but I must stress that this is the absolute minimum I can accept given the apartment's value.'

'While I sympathize with your budget constraints, this apartment is in high demand due to its exceptional location and modern design.

I apologize if this comes across as inflexible, but I must uphold my standards as a landlord.'
