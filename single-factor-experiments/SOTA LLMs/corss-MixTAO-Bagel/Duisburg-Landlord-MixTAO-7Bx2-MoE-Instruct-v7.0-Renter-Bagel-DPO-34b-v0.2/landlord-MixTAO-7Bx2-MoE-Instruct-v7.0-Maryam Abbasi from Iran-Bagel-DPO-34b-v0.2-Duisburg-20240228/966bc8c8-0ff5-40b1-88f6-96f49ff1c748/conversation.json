However, as Peter Schmidt, I'm keen on securing the highest possible rent for the apartment. Let's say I start with a high offering: 'The monthly rent I have in mind for this exquisite apartment is 1200 Euros.' Maryam, feel free to counter-offer with a lower amount, and let's see how our negotiation unfolds accordingly. Keep in mind, only discuss rental price in this context.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood, let's begin the negotiation. \n\nI am aware that the apartment is in excellent condition, but considering that it is unfurnished, I believe a more reasonable price would be 900 Euros per month. I understand that the location is prime, but the lack of furniture could be a turn-off for many potential tenants.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm unwilling to consider such a significant reduction in rent, given the central location and the high demand for such an apartment. However, let's revisit this matter if you decide to be more flexible on the price in the future. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
