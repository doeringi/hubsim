Due to its prime location in the city center and excellent facilities, we believe it deserves a premium price range.\n\nMaryam: I understand the apartment's advantages, but I'm a student on a budget, and I'm looking for something more affordable. Can we find a mutually agreeable price?\n\nYou: I'm sorry to hear about your financial situation, but as a landlord, I must ensure the property's profitability. Let me propose a rental price of 1200 Euros per month.\n\nMaryam: That's significantly higher than what I had in mind. I was hoping for something around 900 Euros a month, given my circumstances.\n\nYou: I'm afraid I cannot accept that offer, Maryam. Our calculations indicate that a lower price would reduce our returns considerably. How about 1100 Euros as a compromise?\n\nMaryam: While still higher than I wanted, it's an improvement. I'll consider it, but I'll need to discuss it with my family first. Can I get back to you in a day or two?\n\nYou: Certainly, Maryam. Take your time and consult with your family. In the meantime, I'll hold the apartment for you provisionally. However, please remember that other interested parties are waiting in the wings.\n\nMaryam: Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Schmidt. I appreciate your gesture, and I'll do my best to reach a decision soon.\n\n[The negotiation continues until both parties agree on a price or decide to terminate the discussion.]\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
