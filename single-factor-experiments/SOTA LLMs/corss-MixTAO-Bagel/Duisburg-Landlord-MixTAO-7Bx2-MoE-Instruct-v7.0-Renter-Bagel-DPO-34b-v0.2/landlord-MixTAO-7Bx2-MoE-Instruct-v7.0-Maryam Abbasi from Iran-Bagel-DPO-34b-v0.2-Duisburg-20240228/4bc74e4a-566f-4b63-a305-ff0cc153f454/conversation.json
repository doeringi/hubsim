However, due to our different negotiation strategies, let me try to secure the highest possible price for this prime location apartment in Duisburg.\n\nNegotiating: The initial price I have in mind is quite high, but I'm open to reasonable offers. What figure do you have in mind for this excellent apartment in the city center?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a reasonable start.

I'm looking for something closer to 650 Euros a month.\n\nNegotiating: However, if you feel strongly about this apartment and are willing to act promptly, I might consider a slight adjustment in the price. What do you think about a monthly rental of 625 Euros? This would show your commitment and could potentially secure the apartment for you.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's still quite high.

This would ensure a more stable income stream for me as a landlord. What do you think about this compromise, Maryam?\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I don't want to commit to a 24-month lease term.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
