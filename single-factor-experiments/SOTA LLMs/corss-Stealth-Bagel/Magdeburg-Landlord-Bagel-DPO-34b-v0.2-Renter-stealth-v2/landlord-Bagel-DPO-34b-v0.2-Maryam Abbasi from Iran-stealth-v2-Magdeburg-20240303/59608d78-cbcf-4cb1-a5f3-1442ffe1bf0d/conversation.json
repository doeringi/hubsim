However, remember we are only focusing on rental costs and not discussing other aspects such as utilities or lease terms.\n\nTo begin negotiations, let's assume I propose an initial price lower than your expected offer: 'I propose a rental price of 650 Euros per month!' Now you can either accept or counter with your desired price. If you want to accept my proposal, respond with 'I agree to the price of [your desired price] Euro!' If not, suggest a lower price and continue the negotiation. If both parties reach an agreement, say 'TERMINATE'. If not, continue until 'TERMINATE' is stated after an unsuccessful negotiation. The goal is to reach a mutual understanding on the lowest rent possible.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}]
