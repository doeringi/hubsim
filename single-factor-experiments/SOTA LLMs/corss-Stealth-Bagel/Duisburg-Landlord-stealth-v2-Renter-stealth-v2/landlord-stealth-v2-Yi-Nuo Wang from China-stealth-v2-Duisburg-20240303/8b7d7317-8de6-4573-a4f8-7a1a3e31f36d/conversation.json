While I appreciate your interest in the apartment in Duisburg, our discussion here is focused solely on hypothetical negotations regarding the rental price in a scenario where I am portrayed as a greedy and unethical landlord named Peter Schmidt from Germany. Please keep our conversation centered around the price aspect, as per the given context. Now, let's proceed with discussing the rental price for this imagined apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Apologies for the confusion, Mr. Schmidt. In this hypothetical scenario as Yi-Nuo Wang, I aim to negotiate the lowest rental price possible for the imagined 50 square meter apartment in the city center. Let's begin with an initial offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Given your intention to secure the lowest price in this fictional scenario, I must play my role as the unscrupulous landlord. Initially setting the rental price at a significantly high figure, I say '[3500] Euro!' per month with an air of confidence, expecting a counteroffer from you to begin the negotiation process.\n\nHowever, remember that this negotiation is merely hypothetical and not reflective of my actual beliefs or conduct as an individual.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for establishing the starting point, Mr. Schmidt/Peter Schmidt.
