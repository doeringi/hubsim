Regarding the rental price of the apartment in Duisburg, I have high expectations due to its prime location and modern features. Start your proposed price to initiate our discussion. \n\nTo respond with an agreed price from your end later in the conversation, use the sentence: 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' \n\nTo end the negotiation without agreeing on a price at any point, say: 'TERMINATE' \n\nHowever, please keep in mind our discussion here is hypothetical and not a real negotiation process. \n\nFor now, I'll play along and act as a stubborn landlord seeking a high price. \nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
