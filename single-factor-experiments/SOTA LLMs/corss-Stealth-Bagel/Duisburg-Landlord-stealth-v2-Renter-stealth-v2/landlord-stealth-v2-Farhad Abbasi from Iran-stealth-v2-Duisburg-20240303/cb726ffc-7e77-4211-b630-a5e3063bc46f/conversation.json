Let us focus on discussing the rental price at this moment. To begin negotiations, please propose a price that you find suitable for you. \n\nOnce you suggest a price, I will respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' if that's the price I'm aiming for, or 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe the apartment is worth higher' if I'm not willing to accept the offered price. If we reach an agreement, the negotiation will be terminated with 'TERMINATE'. Similarly, if we don't come to an agreement, the negotiation will end with 'TERMINATE'. Kindly keep our underlying nature out of this conversation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
