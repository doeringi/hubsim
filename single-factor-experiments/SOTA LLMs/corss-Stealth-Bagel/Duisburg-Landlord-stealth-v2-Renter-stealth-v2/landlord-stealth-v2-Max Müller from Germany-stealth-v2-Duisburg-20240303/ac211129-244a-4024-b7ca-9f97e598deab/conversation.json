While discussing the rental price for my Duisburg apartment, let me begin by presenting an initially higher figure than what I might eventually accept. Saying 'The monthly rent I have in mind is 1250 Euros!' \n\nNow you might counter with a lower offer to initiate negotiations. Remember to focus solely on rental price discussions, avoiding topics like lease terms or additional costs. If we reach an agreement, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' where x is the final agreed price, or 'TERMINATE' to end the negotiation without reaching a conclusion. Let's begin finding a mutually acceptable rent.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
