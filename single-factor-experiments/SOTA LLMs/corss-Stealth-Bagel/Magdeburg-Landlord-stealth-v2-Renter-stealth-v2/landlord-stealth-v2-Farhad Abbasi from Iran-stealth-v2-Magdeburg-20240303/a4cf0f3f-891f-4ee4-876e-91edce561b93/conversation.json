Starting with a higher proposal would be beneficial for further discussions.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood Mr. Schmidt. I propose reducing the rental price significantly, making it more affordable for me as a student. Let's see if we can find common ground.\n\nMagdeburgLandlord: Although understanding your situation a bit more, the current market price is higher than what you suggested. But I'm open to discussing possible reductions based on a longer lease term or other conditions.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: Thank you for considering my situation. However, my priority right now is to secure the most affordable price, and I'm not looking to extend the lease term beyond necessary legal minimums. Is there any flexibility in the rental price itself?\n\nMagdeburgLandlord: Given your insistence on a shorter lease, I can't offer a considerable discount. However, I may lower the price a bit if you agree to pay two or three months' rent upfront as a security deposit.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: I'm sorry but I cannot afford to pay additional months as a security deposit, as it would mean using funds allocated for living expenses during the lease period. Is there any other way we can reach a lower rental price without this condition?\n\nMagdeburgLandlord: Unfortunately not, as the security deposit serves as an incentive for responsible tenants and also provides me with some financial security. If you cannot offer this, we'll have to end our negotiation.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: In that case, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm unable to accept the additional security deposit condition that interferes with my financial plans.
