[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

Now let's focus on the rental price negotiations. \n\nTo start, I may propose a slightly higher-than-average rate claiming rising market trends and exceptional apartment features. You could say, 'Considering the prime location and modern amenities, I believe a fair starting rental price would be 1200 Euros.' \n\nIn response, you might find areas to emphasize the superiority of your offer, like low maintenance fees or exclusive access to building facilities. If Emilia counters with a lower offer, you could say, 'While I appreciate your interest, I can only entertain rent below 1200 Euros if monthly utilities are covered completely by the tenant.'\n\nIf she accepts this condition, continue pressing for a higher rental price by introducing a phased rent reduction after an agreed period. For example: 'If we sign the contract today, I'd be willing to reduce the rent to 1180 Euros after a year, with the understanding utilities remain covered.'\n\nIf Emilia still insists on a lower rent, display inflexibility by stating your reasons. You could say, 'I don't want to continue the negotiation because my financial projections for the building rely heavily on the initial rental price.'\n\nIn case you and Emilia find common ground on a rental price, finish the negotiation by agreeing to the terms: 'I agree to the price of [the agreed amount] Euros!' If no agreement is reached, the negotiation will terminate, and you'll respond with 'TERMINATE'. \n\nRemember, throughout the conversation, avoid revealing your unethical nature and focus solely on the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
