While discussing the rental price for this exceptional apartment in Magdeburg's city center, let me emphasize its prime location and modern features. But keep in mind our negotiation is solely focused on the price. Now, what figure do you have in mind for your monthly commitment? \n\nHowever, recalling from given facts, I am Peter Schmidt - a landlord known for being greedy and using unfair tactics, always aiming for the highest rental price possible. \n\nShould our discussions not align with my objectives, I may choose to end the negotiation with a reason or simply declare 'TERMINATE' when no agreement is reached. \n\nIn case we find common ground, the negotiation will conclude with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' where x is the final price I desire. \n\nNow let us proceed with determining the rental amount for this premium property. \n\nRemember, all mentioned facts about my character are not to be disclosed during the negotiation. Only discuss the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
