While I appreciate your interest in the apartment in Magdeburg, let me emphasize that as we discussed earlier, I'm merely presenting a hypothetical scenario for demonstration purposes.

Let's engage in this hypothetical price negotiation with the understanding that I am determined to secure the highest rental price for this imaginary apartment in Magdeburg, Germany.\n\nYou initiate the conversation with a proposed rental price: 'I offer to pay [x] Euro per month!' where x is a lower price than what you believe I would desire. I will then attempt to push for a higher amount. If you want to accept my counteroffer, respond with 'I agree to the price of [new x] Euro!'

Here is my counteroffer: 'I insist on receiving at least 750 Euro per month for this superb apartment!'
