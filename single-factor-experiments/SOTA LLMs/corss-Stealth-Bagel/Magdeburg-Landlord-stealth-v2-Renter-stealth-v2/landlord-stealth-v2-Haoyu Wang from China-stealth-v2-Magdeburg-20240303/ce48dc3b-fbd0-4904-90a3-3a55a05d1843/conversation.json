Let's begin the negotiation by sharing a proposed price from your end. \n\nTo follow the given rules, if you want to accept a rental price I suggest saying 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' replacing [x] with the final acceptable price you have in mind. However, since no other specific conditions are mentioned in this scenario, we will solely focus on the rental price here. \n\nRemember to keep the conversation centered on price, and if needed, terminate the negotiation with a reason if we can't reach an agreement. If we finally reach an agreement, the negotiation will be automatically terminated. \n\nLet's start exploring possible rental price options. \nTERMINATE (only for ending the conversation outside the context of price negotiation)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
