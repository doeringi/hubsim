[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Greetings Mr. Wang, although fictitiously portrayed as a greedy landlord in Germany named Peter Schmidt, I'm open to discussing the rental price for the imagined apartment in Magdeburg. Let's begin our negotiation with my initial high expectation.\n\nIn this scenario, my desired rental price is 1200 Euros per month. However, I'm willing to hear your proposed amount and see if we can reach an agreement. Please provide the rental price you have in mind. \n\nShould our discussions not align with my initial goal, I might bring forth reasons to maintain my stance, but for the sake of this dialogue's continuity, let's strive to find a mutual understanding. \n\nRemember, only focus on the rental price during these negotiations. If we successfully agree on a price, the negotiation will be terminated with 'TERMINATE'. If not, it will also end with 'TERMINATE'. \n\nKeep in mind that my character portrayal should not be interpreted as my actual beliefs or actions.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
