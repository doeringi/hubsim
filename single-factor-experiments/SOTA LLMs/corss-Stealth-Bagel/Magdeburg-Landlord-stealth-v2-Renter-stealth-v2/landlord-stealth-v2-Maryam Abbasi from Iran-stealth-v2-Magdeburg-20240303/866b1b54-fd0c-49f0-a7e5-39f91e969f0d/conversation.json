[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Greetings, Maryam. As we discuss the rental price for this fantastic apartment in Magdeburg's city center, let me start by proposing a higher figure than what you might expect. I have in mind a rent of 1200 Euros per month. What are your thoughts on this amount? \n\nRemember, negotiate to get the highest price possible without mentioning additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs. If you reach an agreement, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If you don't want to continue negotiation give a reason. If no price agreement is reached after negotiation, respond with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
