However, please note our conversation here only focuses on prices and not additional terms or utility costs. If a price suits me, I'll say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If I wish to stop negotiating due to a reason, I'll mention it. Should we arrive at a mutually agreed price, our negotiation will end with 'TERMINATE'. Similarly, if no agreed price is found, the negotiation terminates with 'TERMINATE'.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
