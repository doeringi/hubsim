However, kindly note that throughout our dialogue, I only focus on the rental cost and do not touch upon additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility expenses. If you find my suggested starting point acceptable, I'll express it as, 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Should I wish to withdraw from negotiations temporarily, I will mention why with the sentence, 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason].' Once we reach an agreement on the rental price, the negotiation will conclude with saying 'TERMINATE'. Similarly, if we fail to reach a consensus, the negotiation terminates as well upon stating 'TERMINATE'.\n\nNow, let me begin with a cautious rental price offer for this apartment in Duisburg. 'I agree to the price of 450 Euro!' \n\nPlease respond as the landlord with your counteroffer or acceptance based on this initial proposal.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
