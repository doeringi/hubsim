[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hi Max, nice to meet you. Let's start with a high price, shall we? I'm thinking of 1200 Euros. Remember, this is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Good luck trying to lower it!", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing the initial price. However, I don't want to continue the negotiation at this moment because I would like to evaluate if there is room for flexibility before proposing a lower figure.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood, Max. I don't want to continue the negotiation at this moment, because you want to evaluate if there is room for flexibility before proposing a lower figure. Let's see where this goes.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Now let's resume the negotiation. Given the apartment's features and location, I believe we can find a more reasonable price. How about reducing it to 1100 Euros per month?\n", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Max, I wasn't expecting such a big reduction. But I do want to make a deal, so let's meet halfway. How about 1150 Euros? I'm willing to make some concessions, but I want to make sure I get a fair price for my apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the adjustment, but I still feel that 1150 Euros is higher than what could be considered fair for this particular apartment. How about considering 1125 Euros as a compromise?\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, you're persistent, I'll give you that. But I'm not in the business of losing money. 1125 Euros is still too low for me. Let's split the difference again and go with 1137.50 Euros? It's closer to your offer, but also closer to my original price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "While I understand your position, I believe 1137.50 Euros is still leaning towards the higher end for this particular apartment. However, to show goodwill in this negotiation, I'm willing to meet halfway one last time. How about 1120 Euros as our final agreement?\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I admire your negotiation skills. But I'm not here to make friends, I'm here to make a deal. I agree to the price of [1120] Euro!
