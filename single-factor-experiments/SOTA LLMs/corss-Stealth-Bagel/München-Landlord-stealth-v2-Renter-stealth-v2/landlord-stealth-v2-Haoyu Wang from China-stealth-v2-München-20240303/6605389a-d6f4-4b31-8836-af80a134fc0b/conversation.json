[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Greetings, Mr. Wang. Though the given context portrays me as Peter Schmidt, the greedy landlord in Germany, let's engage in this negotiation based on your interest in the apartment. Keeping in mind we only discuss rental prices here, I initially expect a hefty amount for this prime location in M\u00fcnchen's city center with its close proximity to all essential facilities. However, I am open to hearing your proposed rental price.\n\nTo continue the negotiation as Peter Schmidt, respond with a specific price you have in mind to replace 'x' in the sentence: 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' or provide a reason to end the negotiation if needed, with a sentence starting with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because...' \n\nIf we reach an agreement on a price, type 'TERMINATE'. If not, the same word will end the conversation without an agreed price. \n\nPlease note, we are only pretending as this is a fictional scenario and not an actual rental process. Enjoy the roleplay! \n\nFor reference, the apartment is a newly built, unfurnished 50 square-meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center of M\u00fcnchen.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
