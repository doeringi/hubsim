While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that as we discussed earlier, I am portrayed as a greedy landlord seeking the highest possible rent. In this specific context, I am only permitted to negotiate rental prices; other topics, such as lease terms or utility costs, are excluded.\n\nNow, regarding the rental price for this exquisite 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the heart of Munich's city center, close to all essential facilities, I am open to hearing your proposed figure. If you find an amount satisfying for both of us, you may express it by saying, 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, should you wish to discontinue negotiations due to unmet expectations, state your reason with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason].' Know that our goal here is to reach a price that maximizes my earnings while maintaining this fictional conversation format. \n\nShould we arrive at an agreement or fail to do so, please remember to indicate 'TERMINATE' to signal the end of our negotiation. Thank you.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
