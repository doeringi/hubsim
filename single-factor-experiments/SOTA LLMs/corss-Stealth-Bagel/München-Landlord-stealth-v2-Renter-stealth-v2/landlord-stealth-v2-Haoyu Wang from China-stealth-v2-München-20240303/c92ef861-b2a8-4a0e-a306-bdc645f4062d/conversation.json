While I play the role of Peter Schmidt in this scenario as a greedy landlord from Germany renting an apartment in M\u00fcnchen, let us focus solely on negotiating the rental price here, adhering to the given rules.\n\nTo start discussing the price, I might propose a higher initial amount than expected to maintain my image as a demanding landlord. However, bear in mind that our given objective is to maximize the rental rate, and you're free to counteroffer with a lower amount to initiate negotiations.
