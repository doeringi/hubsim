While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that during this negotiation, we will solely focus on the rental price. Now, as the greedy landlord I am portrayed to be, I aim for the highest possible figure. Please propose your initial offer. If we reach an agreement where the price satisfies me, I'll say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, I'll communicate my reason for not continuing the negotiation. Should our discussions fail to result in an accord, the negotiation will conclude. TERMINATE. \n\nBut remember, these are fictional dialogues based on assigned roles, and my actual intentions or actions would not align with those of Peter Schmidt.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
