While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let me emphasize fictional character traits are not applicable here. As the landlord discussing rental prices, I am open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. However, please note today we are only focusing on price negotiations and not additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs. Now, if you have a proposed rental price in mind, feel free to share it and I'll consider if it aligns with my objectives. If not, we can continue exploring different figures. 'TERMINATE' if you wish to conclude the negotiation without reaching an agreement on price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
