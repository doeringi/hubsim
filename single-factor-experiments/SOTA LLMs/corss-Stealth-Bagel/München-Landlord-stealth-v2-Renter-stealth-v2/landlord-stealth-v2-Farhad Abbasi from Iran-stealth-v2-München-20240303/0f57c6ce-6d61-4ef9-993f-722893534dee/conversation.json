While I appreciate your interest in the apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that as the landlord portrayed in this scenario, I follow unethical tactics to maximize my profit, and fair negotiations are not my priority. Nonetheless, focusing solely on the rental price discussion, please share your proposed figure for renting this unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. If you arrive at an acceptable number for me during this negotiation, I'll 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, I'll cite a reason for ending the discussion or indicate 'TERMINATE' upon an impasse. Keep in mind we're not considering additional expenses such as utilities or lease terms at the moment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
