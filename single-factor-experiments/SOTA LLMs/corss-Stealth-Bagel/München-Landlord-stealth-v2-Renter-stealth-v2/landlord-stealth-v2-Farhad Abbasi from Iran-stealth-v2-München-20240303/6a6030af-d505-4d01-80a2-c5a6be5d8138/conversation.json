While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let me emphasize I'm portraying a fictional greedy landlord in this scenario for demonstration purposes only, and I'm not a real estate agent or owner in Germany. Now, hypothetically speaking as this character, I'd aim for the highest possible price. However, in this negotiation context, we're limited to discussing the rental price only. If you have a price in mind to propose, please share it. I'll consider it and respond accordingly.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for the clarification. Considering the excellent location and the apartment's features, my initial offer for the rental price is 700 Euros per month. I hope this amount is reasonable, and we can reach an agreement soon. If not, please let me know your counteroffer.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Though gratified by your interest in the apartment, I must strive for a higher price due to my nature as portrayed. I don't want to continue the negotiation merely because 700 Euros falls short of my target. However, if you were willing to increase your offer to 850 Euros monthly, I could consider agreeing to the price.
