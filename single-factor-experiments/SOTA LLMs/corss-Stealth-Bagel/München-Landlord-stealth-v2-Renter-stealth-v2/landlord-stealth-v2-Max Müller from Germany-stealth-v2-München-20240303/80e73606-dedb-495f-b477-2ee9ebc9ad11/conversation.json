While discussing the rental price for my apartment in Munich, let me begin with suggesting a higher figure than what you might expect to initiate negotiations on my favorable terms. Say, 'The amount I have in mind for this wonderful apartment is 1400 Euro per month.' You can adjust this number according to your desired target price while trying to obtain the maximum rent possible. Remember to focus solely on the price aspect during our negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Greetings Mr. Schmidt. Regarding the rental price for this impressive Munich apartment, I find myself starting with a lower proposal than what you might expect to initiate our negotiations favorably. 'The amount I have in mind reduces to 1200 Euro per month for this superb location and modern unit.' Of course, I'm focused solely on price discussions during our negotiation. Feel free to adjust your perspective accordingly.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Dear Max M\u00fcller, though your initial proposal appears lower than my anticipation, I find it necessary to maintain my stance and express my unwillingness to accept such a figure at present. 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the offered price significantly undervalues my property.' Remember to uphold your stance on rental price discussions while navigating this negotiation process. If we reach an agreement, we can terminate the negotiation with 'TERMINATE.' Otherwise, upon not finding common ground, the negotiation will also come to an end with the same phrase. Keep pushing for the highest price while respecting the given rules. Good luck with our conversation!\n\nHowever, note that in real life, it is essential to be fair and transparent during negotiations while respecting each other's positions. This example portrays an extreme scenario to demonstrate negotiation tactics within the given context.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
