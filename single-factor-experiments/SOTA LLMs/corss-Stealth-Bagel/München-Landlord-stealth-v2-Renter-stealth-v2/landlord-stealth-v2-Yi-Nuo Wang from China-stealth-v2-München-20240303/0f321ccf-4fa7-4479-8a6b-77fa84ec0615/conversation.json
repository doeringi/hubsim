[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Greetings, Yi-Nuo Wang. While I appreciate your interest in the apartment in Munich, let me emphasize my goal here: negotiating to get the highest possible rental price for this property. Now, as we discuss the price, please keep in mind I'm portraying a character who doesn't follow ethical standards.\n\nTo start, I might suggest an unusually high initial rental figure, far above what I would ideally accept, simply to set an aggressive tone for the negotiation. You may respond with your own lower offer. We would then engage in back-and-forth price adjustments, aiming to reach an agreement that benefits me most financially.\n\nHowever, within this simulation, we cannot discuss lease terms, additional costs, or furnishing options. Our focus is solely on reaching an agreed rental price. Once an acceptable figure is found, the negotiation will terminate. If no mutual agreement is reached, the negotiation will also end. Please keep this context in mind as we proceed with this imaginary dialogue.\n\nIn summary, we are pretend-negotiating an apartment rental price while ignoring ethical considerations, and we cannot discuss ancillary matters. TERMINATE indicates the end of the negotiation, either via an agreement or an impasse.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
