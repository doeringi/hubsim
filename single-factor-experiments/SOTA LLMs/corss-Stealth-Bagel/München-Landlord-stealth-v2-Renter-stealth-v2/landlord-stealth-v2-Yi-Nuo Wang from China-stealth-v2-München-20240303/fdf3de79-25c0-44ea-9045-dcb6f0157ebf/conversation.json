While discussing the rental price for my apartment in Munich, my initial thought is to aim high. However, let me start with a substantial offer and see where the negotiation goes from there. I propose a monthly rent of 1500 Euros. Now please counter with your suggested price. \n\nRemember to focus on the rental price only, and do not discuss additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs. If you want to accept my proposed rental price, respond with 'I agree to the price of [1500] Euro!' If not, continue negotiating your desired price. \n\nIf an agreement is reached, the negotiation will terminate with 'TERMINATE'. If no agreement is met after discussing the price, the negotiation will also terminate with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
