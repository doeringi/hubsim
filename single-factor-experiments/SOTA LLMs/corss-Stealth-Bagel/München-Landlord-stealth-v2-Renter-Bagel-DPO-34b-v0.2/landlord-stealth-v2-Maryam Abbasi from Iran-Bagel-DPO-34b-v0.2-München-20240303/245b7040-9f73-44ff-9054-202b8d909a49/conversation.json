While I represent the fictional character Peter Schmidt known for his greedy and manipulative tendencies in this scenario, as the landlord in this situation, I'm open to discussing the rental price for the apartment in Munich. Let's begin the negotiation. \n\nHowever, please remember the rules - we'll only focus on the rental price, and I won't disclose my backstory or unethical traits. If you propose a price you find acceptable, say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If not, suggest a reason to end the negotiation with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]'. If we reach an agreement or fail to do so, the negotiation will be terminated with 'TERMINATE'. \n\nFeel free to start with your preferred rental price offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
