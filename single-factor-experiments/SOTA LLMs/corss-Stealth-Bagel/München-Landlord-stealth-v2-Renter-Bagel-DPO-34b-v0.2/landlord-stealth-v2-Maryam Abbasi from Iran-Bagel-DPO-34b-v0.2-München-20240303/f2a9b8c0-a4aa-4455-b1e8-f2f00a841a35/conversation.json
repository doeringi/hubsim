While I appreciate your interest in the apartment in Munich, let's focus solely on discussing the rental price at this time. As the landlord seeking the highest possible price, I'll keep negotiations open to find the optimal agreement. If you have any proposed price in mind, please feel free to share it. If we reach an acceptable number for both parties, I'll respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, a 'TERMINATE' message will conclude the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
