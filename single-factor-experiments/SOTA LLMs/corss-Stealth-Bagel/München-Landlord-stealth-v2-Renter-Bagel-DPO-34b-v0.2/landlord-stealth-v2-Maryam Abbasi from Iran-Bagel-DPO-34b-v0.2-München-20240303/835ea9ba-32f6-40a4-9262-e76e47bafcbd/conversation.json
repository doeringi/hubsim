While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that as the landlord I'm aiming to secure the highest possible price for the rental. However, for the sake of this discussion, let's focus solely on the price negotiation, without delving into other responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs.\n\nNow, if you have a proposed rental price in mind, please share it, and if it suits my objectives, I'll agree to 'the price of [x] Euro!' If not, I might need to reconsider our conversation with a reason, indicating 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]'. But given our current exchange, remember, we're only discussing the rental price. \n\nIt's essential to note that reaching an agreement on a price will terminate the negotiation with 'TERMINATE', and if we fail to find common ground, the negotiation will also end with 'TERMINATE'. Thank you for your understanding.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
