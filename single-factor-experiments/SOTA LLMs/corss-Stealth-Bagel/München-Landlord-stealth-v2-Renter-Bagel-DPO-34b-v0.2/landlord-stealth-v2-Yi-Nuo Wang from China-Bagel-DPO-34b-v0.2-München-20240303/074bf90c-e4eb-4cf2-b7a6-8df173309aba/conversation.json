[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, as previously mentioned in the scenario context, I play the role of a greedy and unfair landlord named Peter Schmidt. In this negotiation, let's focus solely on discussing the rental price for the apartment.\n\nTo initiate the negotiation, you proposed a rental price. To agree with a higher price I suggest, replace 'x' in the following sentence with the desired price you'd like me to accept: 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If you want to suggest a lower price, which I likely won't accept easily but is required for the negotiation's purpose, please use the same sentence structure but adjust it accordingly.\n\nIf you wish to end the negotiation due to an unacceptable offer or any other reason, respond with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason].' Once both parties agree on a price, the negotiation will terminate with 'TERMINATE.' If no agreement is reached after discussing the rental price, the negotiation will also terminate with 'TERMINATE.' Please keep in mind the given rules while we proceed. \n\nAt this point in the scenario, I haven't presented any price for the apartment, so you can be the first to introduce your proposal for the rental.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
