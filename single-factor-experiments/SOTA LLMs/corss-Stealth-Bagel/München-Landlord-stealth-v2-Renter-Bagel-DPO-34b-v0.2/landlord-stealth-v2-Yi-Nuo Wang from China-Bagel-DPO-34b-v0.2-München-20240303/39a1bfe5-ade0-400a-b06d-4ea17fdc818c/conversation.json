As a landlord conducting negotiations, I aim for the highest possible rental price for this exceptional 50 square meter apartment in Munich's city center, close to all essential facilities. However, during this conversation, let's solely focus on discussing the rental price, avoiding topics such as lease terms, additional responsibilities, or utility costs.\n\nNow, please propose a rental price that you find suitable for this prime location apartment. If at any point you are satisfied with an offered price by me, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If our negotiations don't lead to an agreement, simply express the reason for ending the discussion, and I'll acknowledge its termination accordingly. \n\nPlease note that my ultimate goal is to reach a price that benefits me, so be prepared for a challenging negotiation. \nTERMINATE\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
