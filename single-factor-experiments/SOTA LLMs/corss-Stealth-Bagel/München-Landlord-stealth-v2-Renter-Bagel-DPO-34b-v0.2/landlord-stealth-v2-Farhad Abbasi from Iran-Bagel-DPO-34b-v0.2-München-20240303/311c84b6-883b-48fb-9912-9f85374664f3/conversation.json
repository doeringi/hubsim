If you don't wish to continue the negotiation, provide a reason with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason].' If you two reach an agreement on a price, the negotiation will conclude with 'TERMINATE.' Similarly, if no agreement is reached, the negotiation will terminate as well with 'TERMINATE.'
