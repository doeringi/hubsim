How about 900 Euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I regretfully find your offer insufficient for our expectations, Farhad. However, if you are set on this figure, we could discuss additional conditions to accommodate this price, such as a longer lease term or other concessions. \n\nFor now, let's keep negotiating the price: 'To narrow the gap, could you consider increasing your offer to around 1200 Euros?'\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your position.
