As we discuss the rental price, let me start with a high figure in mind. The apartment is exceptionally located in the city center with easy access to all amenities. Considering this prime location, I propose a monthly rent of 1200 Euros. Now, I'm open to negotiating if you have any lower figure in mind. Do let me know your suggested price. \n\nHowever, please keep in mind the given scenario constraints and focus solely on the rental price. \nTERMINATE if negotiations conclude without an agreed price or if one accepts the proposed 1200 Euros. \nIf continuing negotiations, propose a lower rent and follow the given format. \nFor accepting a price, use 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' with x being the agreed amount. \nDo not reveal the facts about myself or the apartment's nature. \nThis is a chatbot simulation, so there's no physical apartment or negotiation taking place.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
