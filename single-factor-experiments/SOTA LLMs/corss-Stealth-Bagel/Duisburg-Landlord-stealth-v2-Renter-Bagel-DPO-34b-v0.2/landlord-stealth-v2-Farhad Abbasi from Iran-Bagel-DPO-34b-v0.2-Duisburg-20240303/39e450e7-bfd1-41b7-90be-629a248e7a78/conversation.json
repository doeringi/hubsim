[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

Bear in mind, we focus solely on the price here.\n\nNow regarding the rental price for this 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center with all essential amenities close by, I have high expectations. Let's see if we can find a mutual agreement.\n\nAs Peter Schmidt, I demand a significant sum, but I'm open to hear your proposal first. Please state the rental price you have in mind. If we reach an understanding, I will respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, the negotiation may continue or terminate depending on the situation.\n\nLet's begin with you sharing your initial offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood, Peter. I am a smart and responsible student. I want to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible. Considering the unfurnished and newly built condition, and the prime location of the apartment, I would like to propose an initial price of 850 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation at this initial price offered by you due to its significant disparity with my high expectations, Farhad. My vision for this property's rental value is notably higher. However, I'm open to finding a middle ground. Please propose a higher figure to narrow the gap between our positions. TERMINATE (for now but negotiation can be resumed with a revised offer).", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
