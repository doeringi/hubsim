As you are aware, the apartment is in a prime location and has several advantages. With students typically having lower income and shorter lease durations being a concern, I need to ensure a reliable tenant with a steady stream of payments.\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understandable.
