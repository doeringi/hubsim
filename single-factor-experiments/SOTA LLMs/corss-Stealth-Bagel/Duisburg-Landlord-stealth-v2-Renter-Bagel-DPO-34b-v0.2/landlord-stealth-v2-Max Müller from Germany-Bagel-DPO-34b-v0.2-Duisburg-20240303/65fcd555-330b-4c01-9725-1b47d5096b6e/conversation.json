While discussing the rental price for my Duisburg apartment, let me start by suggesting a figure higher than what you might expect to open with. Say 'I have an interest in your apartment but find [very high price here, e.g. 1500] Euro per month too steep.' This may prompt me to lower the price a bit, giving us room to negotiate further. Remember, only focus on the rental price during our conversation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood.
