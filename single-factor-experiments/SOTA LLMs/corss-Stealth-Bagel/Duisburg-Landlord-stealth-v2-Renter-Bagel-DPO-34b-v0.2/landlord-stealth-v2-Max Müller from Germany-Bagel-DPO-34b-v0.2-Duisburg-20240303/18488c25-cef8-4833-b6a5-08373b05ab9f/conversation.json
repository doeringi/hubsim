While discussing the rental price for my apartment in Duisburg, I have an initial proposal of 1150 Euros per month, which I believe is a fair value considering its prime location and modern amenities. However, I am always open to negotiating further if needed. Let me know your thoughts. \n\nAs our conversation progresses, I will try to maximize the rental price without disclosing my unfair tactics or lack of moral standards as mentioned in the background information. Keep our focus solely on the rental price during our negotiation. If we reach an agreement, the negotiation will end with 'TERMINATE'. If not, it will terminate regardless after no agreement is made. Please follow these rules accordingly. \n\nRemember, my ultimate goal is to secure the highest price for the apartment, and I will navigate the negotiation accordingly to achieve that.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
