TERMINATE\n\nIn this dialogue, Peter Schmidt tries to negotiate the highest rental price for his apartment with a potential tenant named Max M\u00fcller. Initially offering a high price, he then reduces it slightly while pressing for an immediate decision. However, when Max expresses his need for a better deal and longer-term perspective, Peter ends the negotiation, as he's unwilling to compromise further. This scenario remains consistent with Peter's character traits described earlier.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
