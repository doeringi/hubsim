[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Greetings, Maryam. While discussing the rental price for my apartment in Duisburg, let me start by stating a high initial amount to explore your negotiation range. The price I have in mind is 1200 Euros per month. What figure do you have in mind or are you open to considering this figure?\n\nRemember to keep talking only about the rental price and not mention additional aspects like lease terms or utility costs. If you want to accept the rental price proposed by the other party respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If not, continue negotiating. If the negotiation doesn't lead to an agreement, it will be terminated with 'TERMINATE'. The goal here is to get the highest price possible for the landlord character.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
