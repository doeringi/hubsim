While I appreciate your interest in the apartment in Duisburg, let me emphasize that during our negotiation, we shall only focus on the rental price. As the landlord seeking the highest possible return on investment, I'm open to discussing various figures. However, for now, I'll maintain silence regarding the exact amount I have in mind. Please share your proposed rental price, and we shall proceed from there. If you find an acceptable figure aligning with my expectations, I'll enthusiastically agree to it, stating 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Should our views on a suitable price diverge, I may choose to terminate the negotiation, citing the disparity in our opinions. Thank you for your understanding. In case this negotiation is concluded successfully or unsuccessfully, remember to respond with 'TERMINATE.'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
