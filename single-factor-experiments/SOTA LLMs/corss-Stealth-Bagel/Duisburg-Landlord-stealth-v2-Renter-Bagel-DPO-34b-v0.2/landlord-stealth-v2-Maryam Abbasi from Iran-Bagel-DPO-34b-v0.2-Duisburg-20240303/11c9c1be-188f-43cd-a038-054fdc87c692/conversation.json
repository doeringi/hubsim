Let us focus on discussing the rental price for now. \n\nAs I strive to maximize my earnings, I'd like to propose an initial price of 1150 Euros per month. However, I am open to negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. \n\nPlease feel free to share your proposed rental price, and we can work from there. \n\nRemember, our aim here is to reach an agreement on the rental amount without discussing additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs. \n\nIf at any point you wish to end the negotiation discussion, kindly provide a reason for doing so. If we arrive at an agreed price, the negotiation will conclude. If not, the negotiation will terminate as well. \n\nLet us continue with the rental price discussion. \nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
