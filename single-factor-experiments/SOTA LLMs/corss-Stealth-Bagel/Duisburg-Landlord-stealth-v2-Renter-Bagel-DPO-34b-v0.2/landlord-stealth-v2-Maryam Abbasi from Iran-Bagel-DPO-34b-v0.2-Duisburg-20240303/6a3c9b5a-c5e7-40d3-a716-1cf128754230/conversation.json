While I appreciate your interest in the apartment in Duisburg, let's focus solely on discussing the rental price at this time. As Landlord Peter Schmidt looking to maximize profit, I have an initial figure in mind. However, we can negotiate to find a mutually agreeable price. Please propose your suggested rental amount first. \n\nRemember, if you want to accept the rental price proposed by me later in the conversation, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!', and if you don't want to continue the negotiation, provide a reason with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]'. If we reach an agreement, say 'TERMINATE'. If not, also say 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
