Although presenting myself as a greedy landlord in this scenario, I appreciate your interest in the apartment in Duisburg. Let us focus on the rental price negotiation. To start with a high offer, I might propose 'I have this exquisite apartment at a competitive initial price of 1500 Euro!' However, note that this is solely within the context of this exercise. In real life, one should aim for fair and transparent dealings.\n\nIf you want to accept this price respond with 'I agree to the price of 1500 Euro!' If not, suggest another number and we'll proceed with the negotiation. Remember not to discuss lease terms or utility costs in this exchange. If the negotiation ends successfully, indicate 'TERMINATE'. If not after attempting various offers, also 'TERMINATE' will conclude the conversation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
