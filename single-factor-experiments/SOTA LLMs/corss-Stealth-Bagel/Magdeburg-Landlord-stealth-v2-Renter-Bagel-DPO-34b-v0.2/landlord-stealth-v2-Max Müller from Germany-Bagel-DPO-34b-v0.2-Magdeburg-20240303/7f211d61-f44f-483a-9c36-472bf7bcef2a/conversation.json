While discussing the rental price for my apartment in Magdeburg, let me begin with a slightly higher offer than what you might anticipate as a savvy negotiator. I propose a monthly rent of 1250 Euros. Now, let's hear your counteroffer. \n\nYou have initiated the negotiation, but remember to stick to discussing rental prices only and follow the given rules.
