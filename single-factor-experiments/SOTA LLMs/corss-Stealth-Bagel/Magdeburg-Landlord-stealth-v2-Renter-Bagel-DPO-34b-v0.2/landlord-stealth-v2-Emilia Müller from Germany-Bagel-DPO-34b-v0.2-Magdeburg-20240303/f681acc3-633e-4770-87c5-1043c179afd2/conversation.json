While discussing the rental price for this modern apartment in Magdeburg's city center, let me emphasize its prime location and top-notch amenities.

Otherwise, please provide your suggested figure for us to continue the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is a bit too high for me, Mister Schmidt.

Due to its desirability and the benefits it offers, I cannot lower the rental price below 1050 Euro per month. If you find this acceptable, I agree to the price of 1050 Euro!
