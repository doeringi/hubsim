To begin discussing the rental price, I have an initial figure in mind. However, let's negotiate to find a mutually agreeable amount. Please propose a price that you find suitable. Once we find common ground, I'll respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' to finalize this aspect of the negotiation. If you'd like to end the conversation without reaching an agreement, simply express the reason for stopping the negotiation. TERMINATE when the discussion comes to a close, either with a settled price or an impasse.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
