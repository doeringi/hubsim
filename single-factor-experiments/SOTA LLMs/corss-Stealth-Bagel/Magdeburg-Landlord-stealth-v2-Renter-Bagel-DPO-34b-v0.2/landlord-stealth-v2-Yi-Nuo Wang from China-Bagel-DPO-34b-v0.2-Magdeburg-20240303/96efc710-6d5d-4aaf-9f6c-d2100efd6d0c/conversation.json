While discussing the rental price for the apartment in Magdeburg, let me start with a significantly higher amount than what I'd ideally accept, trying to extract maximum benefit from this negotiation. I propose a monthly rent of 1200 Euros. How do you respond to this price?\n\nRemember, if you want to accept the rental price proposed by me respond with the following sentence replacing 'x' with the price: 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If not, continue negotiating with a reason why you don't want to continue at that price. If the negotiation is terminated without an agreement, respond with 'TERMINATE'. If an agreement is reached, respond with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
