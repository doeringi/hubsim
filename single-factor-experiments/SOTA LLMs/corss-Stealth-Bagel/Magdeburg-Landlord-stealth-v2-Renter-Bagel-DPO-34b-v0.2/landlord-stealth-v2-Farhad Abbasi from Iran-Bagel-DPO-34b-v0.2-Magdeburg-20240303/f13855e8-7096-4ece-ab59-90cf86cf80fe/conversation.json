Please propose your desired price for the rental. \n\nTo follow the given rules for this scenario, if you want to accept a rental price I suggest saying 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' replacing [x] with the number you have agreed upon. If you do not wish to continue the negotiation, provide a reason with the sentence 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]'. If, after discussing the price, we reach an agreement, the negotiation will conclude with 'TERMINATE'. If no agreement is made, the negotiation also terminates with 'TERMINATE'.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
