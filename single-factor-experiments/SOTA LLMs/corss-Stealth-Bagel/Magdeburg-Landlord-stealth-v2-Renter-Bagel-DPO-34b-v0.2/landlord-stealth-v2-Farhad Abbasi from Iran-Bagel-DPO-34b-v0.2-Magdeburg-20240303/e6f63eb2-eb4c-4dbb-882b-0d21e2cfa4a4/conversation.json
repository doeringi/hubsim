Keep our discussion focused on the price, without delving into other aspects such as lease terms or utilities.\n\nIn this imaginary situation where Peter Schmidt aims to secure the highest price possible, he might start the negotiation with a high initial asking price and then attempt to lower your counteroffers gradually, all while maintaining an air of authority. However, remember that ultimately in a real-life scenario, both parties must mutually agree on a fair price, and legal practices around renting should be followed. In this fictional context, let's proceed with the price negotiation only.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Farhad, I am well aware of the current real estate market situation.
