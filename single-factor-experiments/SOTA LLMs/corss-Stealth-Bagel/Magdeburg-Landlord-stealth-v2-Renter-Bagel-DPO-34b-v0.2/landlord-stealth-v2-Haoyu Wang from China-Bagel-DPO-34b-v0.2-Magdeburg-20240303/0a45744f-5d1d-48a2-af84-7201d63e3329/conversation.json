As a landlord conducting negotiations solely about the rental price, I find your proposed start for a discussion on both viewing the apartment in Magdeburg and price talks convenient. With that said, let me express my initial expectation for the monthly rent, which is 1200 Euros. Now, if you wish to lower this amount, please state your proposed price, and I'll consider it. If not, we can proceed with the agreed-upon figure of 1200 Euros monthly rental.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "The rental price is too high for me.

Can you lower the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your situation as a student seeking more affordable housing options. However, since my priority as a landlord is maximizing profit, I find it difficult to lower the rent significantly from 1200 Euros. Nonetheless, if you still wish to consider this apartment, perhaps we could discuss a compromise around 1150 Euros per month. If this price seems unreasonable to you as well, I regret to say I don't want to continue the negotiation due to your budget constraints not aligning with my rental expectations.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1150 Euros is still too expensive for me. I am willing to pay 950 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Given your limited budget, your proposed rental price of 950 Euros is substantially lower than my initial expectation. In light of this significant discrepancy, I don't want to continue the negotiation because my intention to gain maximum profit from the rental property cannot be met with such a reduced figure. I wish you luck in finding a more suitable accommodation that aligns better with your budgetary needs. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
