This one is truly a gem, located in the heart of the city, close to all the amenities you could need. Now, let's get down to business. I'm sure you're aware of the current market rates for apartments in this area. I've done my research, and I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What's your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What is the purpose of the \"TERMINATE\" keyword?\n\nIt seems like it would be more efficient to just not respond with a counteroffer if the negotiations are over, rather than responding with a specific keyword.\n\nAlso, what happens if both parties agree on a price, but then one party changes their mind and wants to continue negotiating?\n\nLastly, what happens if one party responds with a counteroffer that is higher than their previous offer? Would the negotiation continue with the new counteroffer, or would it be considered a violation of the rules and result in a TERMINATE response?\n\nI'm sorry if these questions seem silly, I'm just trying to understand the reasoning behind the rules.\n\nThank you for your time!", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
