The lowest price I can offer is 450 euros, and that's already a good deal. The apartment is newly built and located in the city center, close to all amenities. It's a great opportunity for a student like you to live in a modern and convenient place.\n\nHowever, I want to make a good first impression, so I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about I include all the appliances you'll need, like a fridge, stove, and washing machine? That way, you won't have to worry about buying them yourself. And I'll also give you a free parking space, so you can park your car right outside the building.\n\nSo, what do you say? Are you ready to make a deal?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Thank you for your offer, but I'm still looking for a better price. Is there any way you could come down to 425 euros?

I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good value for my money.\n\nCan we discuss this further and see if there's a way to come to an agreement that works for both of us?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What is the best way to learn about real estate investing?\n\nThere are many ways to learn about real estate investing, and the best method for you will depend on your learning style, goals, and availability of resources.
