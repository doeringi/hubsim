As a landlord, I'm looking for the best possible price for my property. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter unfurnished apartment in this location should be around 800-900 Euro per month. What's your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "How do you make a negotiation work?\n\nI want to rent a 50 square meter unfurnished apartment in the city center. The landlord is asking for 800 Euro per month, which is a bit above my budget. I'd like to negotiate a lower price.\n\nI'm a responsible and reliable tenant, and I'm willing to commit to a one-year lease. I don't have any pets, and I don't smoke. I'm also willing to pay the first month's rent and a security deposit upfront.\n\nWhat can I say to the landlord to convince them to accept a lower price?\n\nHere are some possible negotiation strategies:\n\n1. Highlight my strengths as a tenant: \"I'm a responsible and reliable tenant, and I'm willing to commit to a one-year lease. I don't have any pets, and I don't smoke. I'm also willing to pay the first month's rent and a security deposit upfront. I think I'd be a great tenant for your apartment, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.\"\n2. Offer a longer lease: \"I'm interested in renting the apartment for a longer period of time, perhaps two or three years. Would you be willing to offer a discount for a longer lease?\"\n3. Ask about potential discounts: \"Are there any discounts available for long-term tenants? I'm willing to commit to a year-long lease, and I'd like to explore any options that might be available to me.\"\n4. Mention the market rate: \"I've done some research, and it seems that the market rate for apartments in this area is around 700-750 Euro per month. I understand that your asking price is higher, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement that works for both of us.\"\n5. Be willing to walk away: \"I really like the apartment, but I'm not comfortable paying the asking price. If we can't come to an agreement, I'm willing to look elsewhere. I'd like to find a place that works for both of us, but I also need to be mindful of my budget.\"\n\nRemember to stay polite, professional, and respectful throughout the negotiation process.
