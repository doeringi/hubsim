I'm looking for a tenant who will pay top dollar for this beautiful place. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center is around 800 Euro per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider a lower price if the tenant is willing to commit to a longer lease term. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What is the purpose of the \"TERMINATE\" keyword?\n\nIt seems like it would be more efficient to just stop responding or say \"I'm not interested in continuing the negotiation\" instead of using a specific keyword. Is there a reason for this?\n\nAlso, what happens if one party says \"TERMINATE\" but the other party doesn't want the negotiation to end? Can the negotiation continue even if one party wants it to stop?</blockquote>  The \"TERMINATE\" keyword is used to indicate that the negotiation has reached a point where it is no longer productive or beneficial for one or both parties to continue. It serves as a clear and concise way to communicate that the negotiation should end.\n\nUsing a specific keyword like \"TERMINATE\" helps to avoid misunderstandings or confusion about the intentions of the parties involved. It creates a clear and unambiguous signal that the negotiation should end, which can help to avoid prolonged and unproductive discussions.\n\nIf one party says \"TERMINATE\" but the other party doesn't want the negotiation to end, the negotiation can continue only if both parties agree to continue. If one party wants to terminate the negotiation and the other party doesn't, the negotiation will end.\n\nIt's important to note that the \"TERMINATE\" keyword is not a magic word that automatically ends the negotiation. It's just a way to communicate that one or both parties want to end the negotiation. If the other party is not willing to accept the termination, the negotiation can continue.\n\nIn summary, the \"TERMINATE\" keyword is a way to clearly communicate that a party wants to end the negotiation. If both parties agree to terminate, the negotiation will end. If one party wants to continue, the negotiation can continue only if the other party agrees.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
