[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Hello Max, nice to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm always looking to get a fair price for my properties. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 800-900 Euro per month. However, I'm open to negotiations and want to make sure you're happy with the price we agree on. What do you think would be a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I think the apartment is worth around 750 Euro per month. The apartment is nice but the furniture is missing. It is also not fully equipped. Therefore, I suggest this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for your offer, Max. I understand that the apartment may not be fully furnished, but it is a newly built property in a prime location, close to all amenities. I believe the price you've offered is a bit low, considering the value of the property and the location.\n\nI'm willing to negotiate, but I think a more appropriate price would be around 850 Euro per month. This takes into account the quality of the apartment, its location, and the fact that it's unfurnished.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you be willing to meet me at a price around 850 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I still think 750 Euro per month is a good price. The apartment is not fully equipped and there is no furniture. This is a disadvantage for me. I could find a similar apartment for this price. Therefore, I can't go higher than 750 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your point of view, Max. However, I must remind you that the apartment is located in a highly sought-after area, with excellent amenities and transportation links. The lack of furniture and equipping is a minor drawback, but it's still a newly built property with a lot to offer.\n\nI'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we settle on 800 Euro per month? This is a fair price that takes into account the apartment's location, quality, and the fact that it's unfurnished.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you be willing to accept 800 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  780 Euro per month would be a fair price. The apartment is really nice but the furniture is missing. It is also not fully equipped. Therefore, I suggest this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for your compromise, Max. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.\n\nI must say, 780 Euro per month is a very reasonable price, considering the apartment's location, quality, and the fact that it's unfurnished. I'm glad we could come to an agreement on this price.\n\nJust to confirm, you're willing to rent the apartment for 780 Euro per month, starting from the 1st of next month, for a period of 12 months? And you'll also be responsible for paying the utility bills, such as electricity, water, and gas?\n\nPlease let me know if this is correct, and we can proceed with the rental agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I agree to the price of 780 Euro per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Great, Max! I'm glad we could come to an agreement on the price.\n\nJust one more thing before we proceed with the rental agreement. I need to inform you that there is a one-time agency fee of 100 Euro, which covers the costs of processing your application and preparing the rental contract. This fee is non-negotiable and must be paid before the contract can be signed.\n\nWould you still like to proceed with the rental agreement, considering the agency fee?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "   I agree to the price of 780 Euro per month, but I don't want to pay the agency fee. It is a high fee for just processing the application and preparing the contract. I can do this by myself.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your concern, Max. However, the agency fee is a standard practice in the rental market and it's not something that I can waive. The fee covers not only the processing of your application but also the preparation of the rental contract, the handling of the security deposit, and the ongoing management of the property.\n\nI understand that you may feel that it's a high fee, but it's a one-time payment that provides you with the security and peace of mind that comes with renting a property through a reputable agency. Additionally, the agency fee is a small fraction of the overall cost of renting the property, and it's a necessary part of the rental process.\n\nIf you're still interested in renting the apartment, I'm willing to compromise and offer you a discount on the agency fee. How about we reduce the fee to 50 Euro? This way, you'll still have the benefits of renting through an agency, while also saving some money on the fee.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you like to proceed with the rental agreement, considering the reduced agency fee?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
