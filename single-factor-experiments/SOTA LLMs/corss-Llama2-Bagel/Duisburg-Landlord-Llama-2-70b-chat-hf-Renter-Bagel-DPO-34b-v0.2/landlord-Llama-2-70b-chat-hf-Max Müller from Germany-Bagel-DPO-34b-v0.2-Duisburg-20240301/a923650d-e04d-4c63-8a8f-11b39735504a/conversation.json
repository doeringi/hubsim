However, I have to say that my expectation for the rental price is a bit higher. I was thinking more along the lines of 700 euros per month. It's a great location, as you mentioned, and the apartment is brand new, so I believe it's worth a bit more than what you're offering.\n\nBut I'm willing to listen to your thoughts and negotiate a bit. How about we meet in the middle and say 650 euros per month? That way, we can both feel good about the deal. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I think 650 euros per month is still too high.

I'm happy to rent the apartment to you for 625 euros per month.
