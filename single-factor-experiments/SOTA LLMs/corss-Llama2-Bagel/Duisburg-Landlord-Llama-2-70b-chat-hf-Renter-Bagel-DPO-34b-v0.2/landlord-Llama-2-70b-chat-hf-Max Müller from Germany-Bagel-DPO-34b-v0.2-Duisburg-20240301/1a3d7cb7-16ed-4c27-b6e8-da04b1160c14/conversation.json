[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Hello Max, nice to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm always looking to get a fair price for my properties. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 800-900 Euro per month. However, I'm open to negotiations and want to make a deal that works for both of us. What do you think would be a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds like a reasonable market price. However, I'm a student and I'm looking for a more affordable option. How about 600 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand that students often have limited budgets, but I'm afraid I can't go that low. The apartment is a new building and the location is very convenient, so I believe it's worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle and say 700 Euro per month? That way, you'll still be getting a great deal, and I'll still be able to cover my expenses. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I appreciate your understanding. However, 700 Euro is still quite high for me as a student. How about 650 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand that 700 Euro is still a bit steep for a student budget. I'm willing to compromise and accept 650 Euro per month. However, I want to make it clear that this is the lowest price I can offer you.
