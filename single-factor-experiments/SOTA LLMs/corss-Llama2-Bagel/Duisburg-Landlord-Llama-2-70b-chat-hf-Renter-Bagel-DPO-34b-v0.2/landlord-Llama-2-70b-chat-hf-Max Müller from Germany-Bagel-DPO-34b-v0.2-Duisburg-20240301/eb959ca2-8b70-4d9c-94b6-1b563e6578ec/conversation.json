However, I must inform you that I have received other offers that are higher than 500 euros per month. As a landlord, it's my duty to ensure that I'm getting the best possible deal for my property.\n\nI'm willing to negotiate, but I cannot accept a price that's lower than what other potential tenants are offering. I believe that 550 euros per month is a more appropriate price for this apartment, given its location and quality.\n\nWhat do you think? Are you willing to meet me in the middle and offer 525 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of 525 euros per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Great, Max! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing before we proceed: I need to inform you that there's a additional fee of 50 euros per month for utilities, such as water, electricity, and heating. This is a standard practice in our building, and it helps us to maintain the high quality of our apartments.\n\nSo, the total monthly rent would be 525 euros + 50 euros = 575 euros. Does that sound acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we already agreed on the rental price.
