[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Hello Farhad, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm always looking to get the best possible price for my properties. So, let's get down to business. What do you think the apartment is worth? What kind of rent are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am a student and I can offer 500 euros per month. I think that is a fair price for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand that you're a student and that your budget is limited. However, I'm afraid that 500 euros per month is not a realistic price for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The average rent for such an apartment in this location is around 800-1000 euros per month.\n\nAs a landlord, I have to consider the costs of maintaining the property, taxes, and other expenses. I cannot afford to rent the apartment to you for 500 euros per month. It's not a sustainable price for me, and it wouldn't be fair to other tenants who are paying the going rate for similar apartments in the building.\n\nI understand that this may be disappointing news, but I hope you can understand my position. If you're interested in the apartment, I'm willing to negotiate and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. Perhaps we could discuss a rent of 600-700 euros per month? That would be a more realistic price point for both of us.\n\nWhat do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your point. I am willing to pay 650 euros per month. I believe that is a fair price for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still cannot accept 650 euros per month as the rent for this apartment. As I mentioned earlier, the average rent for a similar apartment in this location is around 800-1000 euros per month.\n\nI understand that you may have a limited budget, but I cannot rent the apartment to you at a price that is significantly lower than the market rate. It's not sustainable for me as a landlord, and it wouldn't be fair to other tenants who are paying the going rate for similar apartments.\n\nI'm willing to work with you to find a solution that works for both of us. Perhaps we could discuss a rent of 700-750 euros per month? That would be a more realistic price point for both of us, and it would still allow you to live in a nice apartment in a great location.\n\nWhat do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I understand your point.

A rent of 700 euros per month is still lower than the market rate for this apartment, but it's a price that I can accept.\n\nHowever, before we can agree on a rent, I want to make sure that you're aware of the other costs associated with renting this apartment. Utilities, such as electricity, water, and gas, are not included in the rent. You will also be responsible for paying a monthly fee for internet and cable TV, if you choose to have those services.\n\nAdditionally, I want to remind you that the apartment is unfurnished, so you will need to provide your own furniture and appliances.\n\nWith that being said, if you're still interested in renting the apartment for 700 euros per month, I'm willing to accept that price.
