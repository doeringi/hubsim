[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Hello Farhad, it's my pleasure. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm always looking to get a fair price for my properties. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter unfurnished apartment in this location is around 800-900 euros per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider offers that are closer to 1000 euros. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I think the apartment is really nice and the location is perfect. However, I am a student and I am looking for a more affordable option. Can you offer me a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand that as a student, affordability is important to you. I have a responsibility to my investors to get a fair return on my investment, but I'm willing to listen to your offer. Can you tell me what you had in mind for a monthly rent? Keep in mind that the apartment is unfurnished, so you'll need to provide your own furniture and appliances.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Considering that I am a student, I would like to offer 600 euros per month. I hope that it is acceptable for you.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand that 600 euros per month is a more affordable option for you as a student. However, I'm afraid that it's not enough to cover the costs of the apartment, including mortgage, maintenance, and utilities.\n\nI'm willing to negotiate and consider your offer, but I would need to ask for a little more. How about we meet in the middle and say 700 euros per month? That way, we can both benefit from the agreement. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I appreciate your understanding. 700 euros seems more reasonable to me. I agree to the price of 700 euros Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement! I agree to the price of 700 euros per month as well.\n\nJust to clarify, the apartment is unfurnished, so you'll need to provide your own furniture and appliances.
