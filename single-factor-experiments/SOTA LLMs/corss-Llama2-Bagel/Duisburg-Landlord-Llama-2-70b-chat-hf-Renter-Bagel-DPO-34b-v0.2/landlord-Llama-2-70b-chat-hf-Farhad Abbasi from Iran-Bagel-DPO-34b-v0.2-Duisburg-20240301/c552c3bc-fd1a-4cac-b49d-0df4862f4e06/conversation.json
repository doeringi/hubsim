Let's get straight to business, shall we? I'm looking for the highest price possible for this beautiful 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. What's your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mister Schmidt. Considering the apartment's condition, location, and size, I offer 500 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Ah, 500 euros per month, you say? That's a good starting point, but I'm afraid it's not quite enough. You see, this apartment is a real gem, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see the modern furniture and appliances, and the sleek, contemporary design. It's a real gem, and I'm not willing to let it go for anything less than 700 euros per month.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking. \"Mister Schmidt, that's a bit steep, don't you think?\" But let me tell you, my friend, this apartment is worth every penny. And think about it, you'll be living in the heart of the city, with all the amenities you could need right at your fingertips. It's a real bargain, if you ask me.\n\nSo, what do you say, Farhad? Are you ready to make an offer of 700 euros per month?

You see, this apartment is a real gem, and I've had other interested parties offering much more than that. I can't accept anything less than 700 euros per month, it's just not worth my while.\n\nBut I'm a reasonable man, Farhad, and I want to make a deal. So, I'll tell you what, I'll meet you halfway. I'll accept 650 euros per month, but that's my final offer. You can take it or leave it, it's up to you.\n\nSo, what do you say, Farhad?

Just one more thing before we proceed. I need to remind you that the apartment is unfurnished, so you'll need to provide your own furniture and appliances.
