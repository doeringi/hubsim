[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Hello Emilia, nice to meet you. I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. As a landlord, I'm always looking to get the best possible price for my properties. So, let's get down to business. What do you think the apartment is worth? What kind of rental price are you willing to offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am a student and I can offer 450 euros per month for the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Hello Emilia,\n\nThank you for your offer. Unfortunately, the price you've offered is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I had in mind a price around 550 euros per month.\n\nI understand that you're a student and that budget can be a concern. However, keep in mind that this apartment is located in a very convenient area, close to public transportation and amenities, and it's a newly built unfurnished apartment, so it's in great condition.\n\nWould you be willing to negotiate and meet me halfway at 500 euros per month? That would be a fair price for both of us, considering the location and the state of the apartment.\n\nWhat do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your point. However, 500 euros is still quite a lot for me. I am willing to pay 475 euros per month, and I am a dependable and responsible tenant. I can also sign a two years lease.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Hello Emilia,\n\nI appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your offer of a two-year lease. However, I'm afraid that 475 euros per month is still a bit too low for me.\n\nAs a landlord, I have expenses to cover, such as mortgage payments, property taxes, and maintenance costs. I need to ensure that I can cover these expenses and still make a profit.\n\nI understand that you're a student and that budget is a concern, but I'm confident that you'll find the apartment to be a great value for the price. It's a newly built apartment in a prime location, with modern amenities and a comfortable living space.\n\nI'm willing to meet you halfway at 525 euros per month. This is an excellent price for a long-term tenant like yourself, and it will allow me to cover my expenses while still providing you with a comfortable and modern place to live.\n\nWhat do you think? Is 525 euros per month something you'd be comfortable with?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Thank you for your understanding. 525 euros per month is a good price. I agree to the price of 525 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement! 525 euros per month is a fair price for both of us, considering the location and the state of the apartment.\n\nI'm glad you're interested in renting the apartment. Before we proceed, I just need to clarify a few more things.\n\nCan you tell me a bit more about yourself? What do you study, and what are your plans for the future?\n\nAlso, do you have any references or proof of income that you can provide? This is just a standard procedure to ensure that tenants are reliable and able to pay the rent on time.\n\nFinally, are you interested in signing a two-year lease, or would you prefer a shorter-term lease?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I study Computer Science and I plan to work in the tech industry after graduation. I can provide references from my previous landlords and my current employer. I am willing to sign a two years lease, as I plan to stay in Duisburg for the foreseeable future.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Great, it sounds like you have a solid plan for your future. I'm glad to hear that you have previous landlord references and a current employer who can vouch for your reliability. That will definitely help in the application process.\n\nIn terms of the lease, a two-year agreement would be perfect. It will give us both the stability and security we need. I'll make sure to include a clause in the lease that allows for a rent increase after the first year, to account for any changes in the market or other expenses.\n\nNow, let's discuss the move-in process. I'll need to schedule a time for you to come by and sign the lease, and I'll also need to give you a tour of the apartment to make sure you're comfortable with the space.\n\nWould you be available to move in on the 1st of next month? If not, we can discuss alternative dates that work for both of us.\n\nFinally, I'll need to know how you'll be paying the rent. Will you be using a bank transfer, or would you prefer to pay in cash?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "   I am available to move in on the 1st of next month.

Just one more thing, I need to run a background check on you to make sure you're a reliable tenant. It's a standard procedure for all our tenants.\n\nWould you be able to provide me with some personal information, such as your full name, address, and date of birth? This will help me to run the background check smoothly.\n\nOnce the background check is cleared, I'll send you the lease agreement and we can schedule a time for you to move in.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
