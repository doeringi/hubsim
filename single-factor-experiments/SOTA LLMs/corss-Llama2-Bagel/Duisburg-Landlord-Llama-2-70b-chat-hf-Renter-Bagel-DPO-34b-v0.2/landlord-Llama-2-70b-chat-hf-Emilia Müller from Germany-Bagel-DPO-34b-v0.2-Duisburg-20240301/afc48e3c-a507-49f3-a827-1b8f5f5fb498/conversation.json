As a landlord, I'm always looking to get the best possible price for my properties. So, let's get straight to business. What do you think the apartment is worth? What rental price are you willing to offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am a student and I know that the apartment is not furnished. So, I would offer a price of 600 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Hello Emilia,\n\nI must say, you're a very astute student! I appreciate your research and your offer of 600 Euros per month is a good starting point. However, I must inform you that the market rate for a 50 square meter unfurnished apartment in the city center is around 800 Euros per month.\n\nAs a landlord, I have a responsibility to ensure that I'm getting a fair return on my investment. I've recently renovated the apartment and I believe it's worth more than what you're offering. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go too low.\n\nHow about we meet in the middle and say 700 Euros per month? That way, we can both feel good about the deal. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 650 Euros would be more fair, considering that the apartment is unfurnished and I am a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your perspective, Emilia. However, as a landlord, I have to consider my own expenses and the fact that the apartment is located in a prime area. I've already lowered the price considerably from the market rate, and I'm afraid I can't go any lower than 700 Euros per month.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about I include the utility bills in the rent, so you won't have to worry about paying them separately? That way, you'll have more money left over for your studies and other expenses.\n\nSo, what do you say? Is 700 Euros per month, including utilities, a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I agree to the price of 675 Euros per month, including utilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Great, Emilia! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing before we finalize the deal. I need to inform you that there's a one-time cleaning fee of 150 Euros, which will be deducted from your security deposit. This is a standard practice for all my rentals, and it ensures that the apartment is left in a clean and tidy state for the next tenant.\n\nSo, with the cleaning fee included, your total move-in cost will be 825 Euros. This includes the first month's rent, the cleaning fee, and the utility deposit. After that, your monthly rent will be 675 Euros, as we previously agreed.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about this?
