[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Hello Emilia, nice to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for this place. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 800-900 Euro per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider offers that are slightly lower. What's your thoughts on that?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds like a good starting point. Considering the apartment is unfurnished and the facilities are not included in the rent, I think a more reasonable price would be around 700 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I see your point, Emilia. However, I must remind you that this apartment is brand new and has been recently renovated, which justifies a slightly higher price. Moreover, the location is very convenient, with all the necessary facilities nearby. I believe 750 Euros per month would be a fair price, considering the quality and location of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree that the quality and location are good, but I also have to consider my budget as a student. How about 725 Euros per month? I am a responsible tenant and I will take good care of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your concerns, Emilia. However, I must remind you that the rent includes neither furniture nor utilities. As a landlord, I have to consider my expenses, too. I believe 750 Euros per month is already a reasonable price, considering the quality and location of the apartment.\n\nI'm willing to compromise, though. How about we agree on 737 Euros per month? That way, you'll get a nice, furnished apartment in a great location, and I'll still be able to cover my expenses. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That sounds like a fair compromise. I agree to the price of 737 Euros per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Great, Emilia! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing before we proceed: I need to inform you that the apartment is available for a minimum of 6 months. Are you still interested in renting it for that duration?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  That's fine with me. I don't plan on leaving before that anyway.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Excellent! In that case, let's finalize the details. The rent for the apartment will be 737 Euros per month, and the minimum rental period will be 6 months. Utilities such as water, electricity, and gas are not included in the rent, and you will be responsible for paying them separately.\n\nAs a landlord, I am responsible for maintaining the apartment and addressing any issues that may arise. You are expected to keep the apartment clean and tidy, and to report any problems or damages to me promptly.\n\nI also require a security deposit of 1,474 Euros, which will be refunded to you at the end of the rental period, provided there are no damages or outstanding bills.\n\nDo you agree to these terms and conditions?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I understand and agree to these terms and conditions.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Great! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing before we proceed: I need to run a background check on you to make sure you're a reliable tenant. This is a standard procedure for all our renters, and it's nothing to worry about.\n\nMay I have your permission to run this background check? It will only take a few minutes, and I'll be able to give you a definite answer about your application once it's done.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
