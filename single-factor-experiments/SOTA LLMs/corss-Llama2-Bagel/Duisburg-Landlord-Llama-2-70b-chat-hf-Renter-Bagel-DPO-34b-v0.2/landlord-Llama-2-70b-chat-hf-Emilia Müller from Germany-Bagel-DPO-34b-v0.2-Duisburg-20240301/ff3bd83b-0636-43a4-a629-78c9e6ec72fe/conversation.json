Well, I have to say that 500 euros per month is a bit too low for my taste. I was thinking more along the lines of 700 euros per month. After all, it's a brand new apartment in the city center, and I think it's worth every penny.\n\nBut I'm a reasonable man, so I'm willing to listen to your proposal.
