As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for my property. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter unfurnished apartment in this location is around 800-900 Euro per month. However, I'm open to negotiations and I want to hear your offer. What do you think is a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Considering the apartment is close to all important facilities and newly built, I think a fair price would be 700 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I see. Well, I have to say that 700 Euro per month is a bit lower than what I had in mind. As a landlord, I have to think about my own expenses and profits, you know.\n\nHowever, I'm willing to consider your offer. After all, I want to make sure that the apartment is rented out to a reliable tenant like you. So, I'm willing to compromise a bit.\n\nHow about this: we agree on a rent of 725 Euro per month, and we'll include a few extra amenities to sweeten the deal? For example, we could throw in a free parking spot or a complimentary cleaning service once a month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for the offer. However, as a student, I have to consider my budget carefully.

However, as a landlord, I have my own expenses and responsibilities to consider. I'm afraid that 710 Euro per month is a bit too low for me to accept.\n\nI'll tell you what, let's meet in the middle. How about we agree on a rent of 715 Euro per month? That way, we can both feel good about the agreement. Plus, I'll still throw in the free parking spot and monthly cleaning service to sweeten the deal. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That sounds fair. I agree to the price of 715 Euro per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement! Just one more thing before we finalize the deal. I need to remind you that the apartment is unfurnished, so you'll need to bring your own furniture and appliances.
