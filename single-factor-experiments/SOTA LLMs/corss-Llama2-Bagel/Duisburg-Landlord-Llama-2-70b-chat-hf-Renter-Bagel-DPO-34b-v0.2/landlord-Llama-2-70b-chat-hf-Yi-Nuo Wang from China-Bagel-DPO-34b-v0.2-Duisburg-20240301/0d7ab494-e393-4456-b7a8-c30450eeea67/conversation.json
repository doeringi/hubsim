As a landlord, I'm looking to get the highest price possible for this unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. I believe the location and the newness of the apartment justify a higher price.\n\nI'm open to negotiations, but I want to make it clear that I won't accept anything lower than 1,500 Euro per month. This is a fair price considering the amenities and the location.\n\nWhat's your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Hello! I'm interested in renting your apartment. I think it's a great location and the size is perfect for me. I'm willing to offer 1,200 Euro per month. I hope that's a good starting point for our negotiation.\n\nI'm a responsible tenant and I'll take good care of the apartment. I'd also like to mention that I'm a student, so I don't have a regular income. However, I'm willing to provide a guarantee from my parents, who are both professionals and have a steady income.\n\nI hope we can come to an agreement. Let me know if there's anything else you need from me.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Well, Yi-Nuo Wang, I appreciate your offer, but I have to be honest with you. The price you're offering is quite low for this apartment. I understand that you're a student, but this apartment is in high demand due to its location and condition. I'm willing to give a discount for a long-term lease, but 1,200 Euro is too low. \n\nI'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go lower than 1,400 Euro per month.
