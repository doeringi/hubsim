I'm happy to discuss the rental price of the apartment with you. As you know, this is a brand new, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, with easy access to all amenities. I believe the market rate for such a property would be around 1200-1300 euros per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider a lower price for the right tenant.
