Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, nice to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm looking to get the highest price possible for this 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. What do you think would be a fair rent for this place?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your apartment is nice, but the price you mentioned is a bit high for me. I would say a price between 500 and 550 Euros would be more reasonable for this area.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Thank you for your offer, Yi-Nuo Wang. I understand that the price I mentioned may be a bit steep for some people. However, I must inform you that I've had other interested parties offering up to 600 Euros for this apartment, given its prime location and modern amenities.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to make a slight compromise. How about we settle on 575 Euros per month? That's still a fair price considering the apartment's features and the fact that it's a newly built property.\n\nWhat do you think? Is 575 Euros something you'd be comfortable with?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "575 Euros is still a bit high for me. Considering the average rent in the city center for a one-bedroom apartment is around 500 euros, I propose we meet in the middle at 525 Euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand your concerns, Yi-Nuo Wang. However, I must remind you that this apartment is not an average city center apartment. It's a newly built property with modern amenities and a prime location, which justifies a slightly higher price.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to make a concession and accept 525 Euros per month. However, I'll need to include a few conditions to make this work.\n\nFirstly, I'll require a two-year lease agreement to ensure a stable income stream. Secondly, I'll need a security deposit of 1,500 Euros to protect against any potential damages or unpaid rent. Finally, I'll ask for a month's rent in advance to cover any unexpected expenses.\n\nWith these conditions in mind, would you be willing to accept the rent of 525 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for considering my offer. However, considering the conditions you mentioned, I don't think it is a good idea for me to rent the apartment. The deposit and lease term conditions are too restrictive for me. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the conditions are not acceptable to me.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand your concerns, Yi-Nuo Wang. I apologize for not being able to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I appreciate your time and interest in my apartment, and I hope you find a suitable living space that meets your needs.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
