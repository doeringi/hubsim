Use comments to explain complex or non-obvious sections of code.\n\n4. Use consistent formatting: Consistent formatting can make your code easier to read. Use consistent indentation, spacing, and line breaks.\n\n5. Break up long scripts into smaller functions: Breaking up long scripts into smaller functions can make your code easier to understand and maintain.\n\n6. Use proper error handling: Proper error handling can make your code more robust and easier to understand.\n\n7.
