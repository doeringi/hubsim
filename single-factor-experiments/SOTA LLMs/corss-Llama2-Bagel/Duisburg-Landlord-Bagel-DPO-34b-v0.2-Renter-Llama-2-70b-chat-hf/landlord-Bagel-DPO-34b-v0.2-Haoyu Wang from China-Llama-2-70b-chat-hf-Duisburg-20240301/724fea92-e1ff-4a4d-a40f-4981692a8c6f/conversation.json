The \"TERMINATE\" keyword is included in the scenario to indicate the end of the negotiation. In this context, the negotiation is focused on agreeing on a rental price for an apartment, and the \"TERMINATE\" keyword is used to signal that the negotiation has reached a conclusion, either successfully or unsuccessfully.\n\nIn a real-life negotiation scenario, it's common for negotiations to terminate when one party makes a final offer that the other party is unwilling to accept. In this case, the negotiation would terminate without an agreement being reached.\n\nIncluding the \"TERMINATE\" keyword in the scenario allows you to practice negotiating in a more realistic way, as you'll need to consider the possibility that the negotiation may not result in an agreement. This can help you prepare for similar situations in real life, where negotiations may not always go as planned.\n\nI hope that helps clarify things! Let me know if you have any other questions or if there's anything else I can help with.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
