Lease term: The agreement should specify the start and end date of the lease, as well as any renewal or termination options.\n3. Security deposit: The agreement should state the amount of the security deposit, how it will be used, and how it will be returned at the end of the lease.\n4. Use of property: The agreement should outline the terms of tenancy, including the number of occupants, pets, and any restrictions on the use of the property.\n5. Maintenance and repairs: The agreement should specify who is responsible for maintaining and repairing the property, as well as how to report any issues.\n6.

At the end of the lease term, the tenant must vacate the property, unless the lease includes an option to renew. Leases are typically used for long-term rentals, and they offer tenants more security and stability than a rental agreement.\n\nA rental agreement, on the other hand, is a contract that outlines the terms of a short-term rental, typically for a period of less than six months. Rental agreements are more flexible than leases and can be terminated by either party with a certain amount of notice. Rental agreements are commonly used for short-term rentals, such as vacation rentals or temporary housing.\n\nIn summary, a lease is a contract that grants a tenant the right to occupy a property for a fixed period of time, while a rental agreement is a contract that outlines the terms of a short-term rental.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "[yourname], thank you for your explanation of the differences between a lease and a rental agreement.
