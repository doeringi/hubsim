As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for my property. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 1200 Euro per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider offers that are closer to 1500 Euro per month.

They claim that these issues don't exist, but I have evidence that they do. I've tried talking to them about it, but they just brush it off and tell me that I'm being too picky. I'm getting frustrated because I'm paying good money to live in a place that's not being maintained properly. What should I do?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " It's understandable that you're frustrated with your landlord's response to the issues you've raised. Here are some steps you can take to try to resolve the disagreement:\n\n1. Document the issues: Make a list of the issues you've identified, including the leaky faucet, cracked window, and faulty electrical outlet. Take photos or videos to document the problems. This will help you prove the existence of the issues and provide evidence of their severity.\n2. Send a formal letter: Write a formal letter to your landlord detailing the issues and requesting that they be addressed. Be sure to include the evidence you've collected, such as photos or videos. Send the letter via certified mail, return receipt requested, to ensure that your landlord receives it.\n3. Set a deadline: In your letter, set a deadline for your landlord to respond to your concerns and fix the issues. This will give them a clear timeline for addressing the problems.\n4. Follow up: If your landlord doesn't respond or doesn't fix the issues by the deadline you've set, follow up with another letter or email. This time, consider copying a local housing authority or a tenant rights organization, such as the National Association of Tenant Organizations. This can help put pressure on your landlord to take action.\n5. Seek legal advice: If your landlord continues to ignore your concerns, consider seeking legal advice from a tenant rights attorney. They can help you understand your rights and options, such as filing a complaint with a local housing authority or taking legal action against your landlord.\n6. Consider withholding rent: If your landlord refuses to address the issues, you may want to consider withholding rent until they are fixed. However, before taking this step, consult with a tenant rights attorney to ensure that you're following the proper procedures and avoiding any potential legal consequences.\n7. Move out: If your landlord still doesn't address the issues, you may need to consider finding a new place to live. If you're unable to resolve the dispute and your landlord won't fix the problems, it may be time to move on.\n\nRemember to stay calm and professional throughout the process. Keep detailed records of all correspondence and interactions with your landlord, and don't hesitate to seek help from a tenant rights organization or attorney if needed.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What are the differences between a JIR and a KIR?\n\nA JIR is a journal of intermediate research, while a KIR is a knowledge intermediate report.\n\nA JIR is a peer-reviewed publication that aims to provide a platform for researchers to share their findings and ideas with a wider audience. It is typically published on a regular basis, such as quarterly or bi-annually, and includes a collection of articles, reviews, and other scholarly content.\n\nA KIR, on the other hand, is a document that provides an overview of the current state of knowledge on a particular topic or issue. It is designed to be a concise and accessible summary of the key findings and implications of research on a specific topic, and is often used to inform decision-making and policy development.\n\nWhile both JIRs and KIRs provide valuable insights into the latest research and knowledge in a particular field, there are some key differences between the two.

Frequency: JIRs are typically published on a regular basis, such as quarterly or bi-annually, while KIRs may be published less frequently, such as annually or on an ad hoc basis.\n5. Length: JIRs can vary in length, depending on the articles and other content included in each issue. KIRs, on the other hand, are typically shorter documents, often ranging from 10 to 50 pages in length.\n6.

However, there are also concerns about AI replacing human teachers, perpetuating biases, and compromising student privacy.\n\nIn my opinion, the use of artificial intelligence in education can be beneficial if it is used ethically and responsibly. AI can help teachers by taking on tasks such as grading, data analysis, and identifying learning gaps, which can free up time for more hands-on, human interaction with students. Additionally, AI-powered adaptive learning systems can provide students with personalized learning paths and real-time feedback, which can lead to more effective learning outcomes.\n\nHowever, it is important to ensure that AI is not used to replace human teachers entirely. Human teachers are essential for providing emotional support, guidance, and socialization, which are critical for students' overall development. Moreover, AI systems can perpetuate biases and discrimination if they are trained on biased data or designed with a particular worldview. Therefore, it is crucial to address these concerns and ensure that AI is used in a way that promotes equity, diversity, and inclusivity.\n\nFurthermore, the use of AI in education raises concerns about student privacy. AI systems often require access to vast amounts of student data, which can include personal information, learning habits, and performance records.
