It is appropriate to use the keyword when an agreement has been reached or when the negotiation has reached an impasse and further discussion is deemed futile.\n\nWhen the &quot;TERMINATE&quot; keyword is used, the negotiation dialogue is terminated, and the parties move on to the next step, which may involve finalizing the agreement or seeking alternative solutions.\n\nThe use of the &quot;TERMINATE&quot; keyword helps to streamline the negotiation process and avoid unnecessary prolongation of the discussion. It also serves as a clear indication of the end of the negotiation, preventing any confusion or misunderstandings.\n\nIn summary, the &quot;TERMINATE&quot; keyword is an essential part of the negotiation dialogue, allowing the parties to efficiently and effectively conclude the negotiation process.\n\nI hope this helps, Haoyu Wang. Let me know if you have any further questions.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
