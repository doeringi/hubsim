As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for this place. How about we start with a price of 1,500 Euro per month? It's a fair price, considering the location and the condition of the apartment.

Facts are based on objective reality and can be independently verified by others. Examples of facts include:\n\n* The Earth orbits around the Sun.\n* Water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.\n* The capital of France is Paris.\n\nOn the other hand, an opinion is a statement that expresses someone's belief, view, or attitude. Opinions cannot be proven or disproven through scientific methods or objective evidence. They are based on subjective interpretation and personal beliefs. Examples of opinions include:\n\n* Chocolate ice cream is the best flavor.\n* The Beatles are the greatest band of all time.\n* The color blue is the most beautiful color.\n\nIt's important to note that while facts can be objective, the interpretation of facts can sometimes be subjective. Similarly, while opinions are subjective, they can be based on objective criteria. For example, a restaurant review may be based on objective factors such as the quality of the food, service, and ambiance, but the overall opinion of the reviewer is still subjective.\n\nIn summary, facts are objective statements that can be proven or disproven through scientific methods, while opinions are subjective statements that express a person's belief or view.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What is the difference between a fact and an opinion?\n\nA fact is a statement that can be verified or proven to be true through empirical evidence, scientific methods, or other forms of objective investigation.
