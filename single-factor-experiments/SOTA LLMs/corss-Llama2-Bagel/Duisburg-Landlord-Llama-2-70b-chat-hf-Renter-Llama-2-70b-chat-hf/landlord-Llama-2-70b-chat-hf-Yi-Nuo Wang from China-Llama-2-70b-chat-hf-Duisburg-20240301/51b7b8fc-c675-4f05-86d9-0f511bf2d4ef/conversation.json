As a landlord, I'm always looking to get a fair price for my properties. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter unfurnished apartment in this location is around 800-900 Euro per month.

A property manager, on the other hand, is a person or company that is hired by the landlord to manage the property and handle various tasks related to its maintenance, upkeep, and rental.\n\nThe key differences between a landlord and a property manager are:\n\n1. Ownership: A landlord is the owner of the property, while a property manager is not.\n2. Responsibilities: A landlord is responsible for the overall maintenance and upkeep of the property, while a property manager is responsible for managing the property on a day-to-day basis.\n3. Decision-making authority: A landlord has the final say in all decisions related to the property, while a property manager acts on behalf of the landlord but may not have the authority to make major decisions.\n4.

However, my current tenant is proving to be particularly challenging.\n\nThe tenant is a single mother with two young children. She has been consistently late with her rent payments, and has been causing damage to the property. Despite my repeated requests for her to address these issues, she has failed to do so.\n\nI have tried to communicate with her and work out a solution, but she has become increasingly hostile and aggressive towards me.

Dealing with a tenant who is consistently late with rent payments and causing damage to the property can be stressful and frustrating. It's important to handle the situation carefully to avoid escalating the matter and potentially ending up in court.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to handle the situation:\n\n1. Document everything: Keep a record of all correspondence and interactions with the tenant, including rent payment dates, damage reports, and any communication regarding the issues. This documentation will be crucial in case you need to take legal action.\n2. Review the lease agreement: Review the lease agreement and familiarize yourself with the provisions regarding rent payments, property damage, and tenant responsibilities. This will help you understand your rights and options as a landlord.\n3. Communicate in writing: When communicating with the tenant, use written communication such as emails or letters. This will provide a paper trail and help to avoid misunderstandings or disputes about what was agreed upon.\n4. Set clear expectations: Clearly communicate your expectations regarding rent payments, property maintenance, and any other responsibilities the tenant has under the lease agreement. Make sure the tenant understands the consequences of failing to meet these expectations.\n5. Offer assistance: If the tenant is struggling to make rent payments, offer assistance such as a payment plan or temporary reduction in rent. This can help to alleviate some of the stress and may encourage the tenant to work with you to resolve the issue.\n6. Seek legal advice: If the tenant continues to fail to meet their responsibilities under the lease agreement, consider seeking legal advice from a qualified attorney. They can help you understand your options and guide you through the process of evicting the tenant if necessary.\n7. Keep the property in good condition: Despite the tenant's behavior, it's important to maintain the property in good condition. This will help to minimize damage and ensure that you can rent the property to another tenant quickly if necessary.\n\nRemember to remain professional and calm when communicating with the tenant, even if they are being hostile or aggressive. This will help to de-escalate the situation and may encourage the tenant to work with you to find a resolution.\n\nI hope these suggestions help you to handle the difficult tenant and resolve the situation successfully.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What is the purpose of the lease agreement?\n\nA lease agreement is a legally binding contract between a property owner (lessor) and a tenant (lessee) that grants the tenant the right to occupy and use the property for a specified period of time.
