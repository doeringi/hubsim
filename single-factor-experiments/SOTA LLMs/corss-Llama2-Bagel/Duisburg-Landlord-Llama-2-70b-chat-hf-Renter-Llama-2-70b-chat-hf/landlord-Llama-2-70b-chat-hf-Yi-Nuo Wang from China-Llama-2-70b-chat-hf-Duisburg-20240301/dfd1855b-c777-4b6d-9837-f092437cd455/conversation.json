As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for my property. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter unfurnished apartment in this location is around 800-900 euros per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider offers that are closer to 1000 euros per month. What do you think would be a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What is the purpose of the \"TERMINATE\" keyword in the negotiation dialogue?\n\nIn the negotiation dialogue, the \"TERMINATE\" keyword is used to indicate that the negotiation has been terminated. It is used in the following situations:\n\n1. When an agreement has been reached: When the negotiators have agreed on a price, the negotiation is terminated, and the \"TERMINATE\" keyword is used to confirm the agreement.\n2. When no agreement has been reached: If the negotiators are unable to reach an agreement, the negotiation is terminated, and the \"TERMINATE\" keyword is used to indicate that the negotiation has been unsuccessful.\n\nThe \"TERMINATE\" keyword is important because it provides a clear and concise way to end the negotiation. It helps to avoid confusion or misunderstandings about the status of the negotiation, and it allows the parties to move on to other issues or agreements.\n\nIn summary, the \"TERMINATE\" keyword is used in the negotiation dialogue to indicate that the negotiation has been terminated, either because an agreement has been reached or because no agreement has been reached. Its purpose is to provide a clear and concise way to end the negotiation and to avoid confusion or misunderstandings.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
