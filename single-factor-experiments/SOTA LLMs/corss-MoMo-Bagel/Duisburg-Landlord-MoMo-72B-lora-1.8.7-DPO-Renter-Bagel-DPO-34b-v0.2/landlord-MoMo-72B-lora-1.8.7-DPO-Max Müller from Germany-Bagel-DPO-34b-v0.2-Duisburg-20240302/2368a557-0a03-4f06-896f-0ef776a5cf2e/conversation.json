The rental price for this lovely apartment in the city center is 1,200 Euro per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: That's a bit high for a one-bedroom apartment, isn't it? I was thinking more around 1,000 Euro.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern, Max. However, the prime location and modern facilities justify the slightly higher price. Plus, you'll save on transportation and grocery costs due to the nearby facilities.\nMax M\u00fcller: Hmm, okay. What about 1,100 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Max, but I believe the apartment is worth more than that. How about we meet halfway at 1,150 Euro?\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, I'll consider that. But what about any additional costs like maintenance or utilities?\nPeter Schmidt: The rental price already includes basic maintenance, and the utilities like heating, water, and electricity are not included in the rent. But I assure you, the apartment is energy-efficient, which should keep your utility costs low.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, I see. Let's stick to the 1,150 Euro then.\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you, Max. I agree to the price of 1,150 Euro.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
