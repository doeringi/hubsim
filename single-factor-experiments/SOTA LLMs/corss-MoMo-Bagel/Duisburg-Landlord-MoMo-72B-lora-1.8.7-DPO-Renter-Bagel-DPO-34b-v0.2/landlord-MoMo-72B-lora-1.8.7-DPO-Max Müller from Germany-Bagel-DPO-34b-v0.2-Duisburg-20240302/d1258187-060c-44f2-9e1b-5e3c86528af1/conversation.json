Let's discuss the rental price. I believe a fair price for this newly built apartment in the city center would be 1,200 Euros per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: That's a little higher than I expected. I was thinking more around 1,000 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand, Max. However, the prime location and modern features of the apartment justify the higher price. Still, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at 1,100 Euros?\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, let's consider that. But what about utilities? Will they be included in the rental price?\nPeter Schmidt: I'm sorry, but utilities like heating, water, and electricity are not included. They will be separate expenses for the tenant.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright. Considering the location and the apartment's features, I think 1,050 Euros would be a fair compromise for me.\nPeter Schmidt: Hmm, 1,050 Euros is still lower than my initial offer. However, I appreciate your interest in the apartment. Let me think about it. How about we settle on 1,125 Euros?\nMax M\u00fcller: That's quite close to your original offer. I'm still hesitant. What if we agree on 1,075 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: Very well, Max. I agree to the price of 1,075 Euros per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: Great! Thank you for your flexibility, Peter.\nPeter Schmidt: You're welcome, Max. I'm glad we could find a mutually agreeable price. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
