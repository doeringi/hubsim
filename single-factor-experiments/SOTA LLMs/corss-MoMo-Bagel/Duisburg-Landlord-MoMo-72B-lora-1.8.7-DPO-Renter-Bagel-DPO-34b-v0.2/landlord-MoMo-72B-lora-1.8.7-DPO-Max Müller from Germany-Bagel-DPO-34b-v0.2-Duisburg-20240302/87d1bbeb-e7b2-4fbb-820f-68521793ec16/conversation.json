The apartment is in a prime location, close to all amenities. I believe 1,200 Euro per month would be a fair rental price for this newly built 50 sqm one-bedroom apartment in the city center.\nMax M\u00fcller: I understand its location is convenient, but do you think 1,200 Euro is a bit high? What about 1,000 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point, Herr M\u00fcller. However, the apartment's modern features and convenient location justify a higher price. I could consider a reduced price of 1,100 Euro per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, let's split the difference. How about 1,050 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: That's still below my initial offer, but I appreciate your effort to compromise. I'll agree to the price of 1,075 Euro.\nMax M\u00fcller: Hmm, 1,075 Euro is closer to your initial offer. Can we meet at 1,050 Euro, and I'll handle any minor repairs or maintenance issues myself?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, but I'm concerned that 1,050 Euro might not be enough to cover my expenses. However, since you're willing to take care of minor repairs, I'll agree to the price of 1,050 Euro.\nMax M\u00fcller: Thank you, Peter. That's a deal.
