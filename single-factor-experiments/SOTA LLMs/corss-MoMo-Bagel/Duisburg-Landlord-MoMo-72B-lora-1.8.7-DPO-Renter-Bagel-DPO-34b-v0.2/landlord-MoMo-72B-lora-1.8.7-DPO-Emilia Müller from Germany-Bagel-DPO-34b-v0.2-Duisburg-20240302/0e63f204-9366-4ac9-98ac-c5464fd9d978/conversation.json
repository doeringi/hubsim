I'm glad you're interested. I am offering this apartment for a monthly rent of 1,200 Euros.\n\n(Continuing the negotiation as Peter Schmidt)\nPeter Schmidt: How about we discuss the rental price? I believe my apartment's prime location and modern features justify the 1,200 Euro asking price.\nEmilia: I understand the apartment's value, but I was hoping for a lower price, perhaps around 1,000 Euros a month.\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, but I must consider the market value and maintenance costs. What if I agree to a price of 1,100 Euros?\nEmilia: I see your point. However, I'm still not sure if I can afford that. Would you consider 1,050 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, but I think 1,100 Euros is a fair compromise. It's only a 50 Euro difference from your initial offer and still covers the expenses.\nEmilia: Alright, 1,100 Euros it is. I agree to the price of 1,100 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: Excellent! I agree to the price of 1,100 Euros as well. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
