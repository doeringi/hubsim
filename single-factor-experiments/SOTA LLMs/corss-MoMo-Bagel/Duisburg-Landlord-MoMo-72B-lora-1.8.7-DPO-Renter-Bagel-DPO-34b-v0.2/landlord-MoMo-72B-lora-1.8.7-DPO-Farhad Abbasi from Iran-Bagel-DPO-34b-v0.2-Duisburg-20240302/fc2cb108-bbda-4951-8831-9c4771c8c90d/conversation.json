To give you an idea, I'm considering a rental price of 1,000 Euro per month. What do you think?\nFarhad Abbasi: I understand that it's in the city center, but 1,000 Euro seems a bit high. What if I offer you 800 Euro per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Herr Abbasi, but I think the apartment is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle and go for 900 Euro per month?\nFarhad Abbasi: I can't go above 850 Euro, as it's a bit tight for my budget.\nPeter Schmidt: I see your concern, but the apartment's location and amenities make it quite valuable. If I could offer you any flexibility, it would be 875 Euro per month.\nFarhad Abbasi: I appreciate your effort, but 850 Euro is my final offer.\nPeter Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe the apartment's worth more than your final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "[end of roleplay]", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " [end of roleplay]", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Can you tell me about the latest advancements in artificial intelligence?\nAssistant: AI has made significant advancements in recent years, particularly in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning.
