[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

The apartment is a lovely space, and I'm certain it would be a great fit for you. As for the rental price, it's a newly built 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, so I'm looking for a monthly rent of 1500 Euro.\nFarhad Abbasi: That seems a bit high. How about 1200 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Herr Abbasi, but the apartment's prime location and modern features make it worth the higher price. What about 1400 Euro?\nFarhad Abbasi: Still a bit more than I'd like to pay. Can we meet somewhere in between?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand, but the apartment is in high demand. I could consider a reduced price of 1350 Euro, which is already taking into account your negotiation.\nFarhad Abbasi: Alright, I'll consider that. But what about the utility costs like heating, water, and electricity? Are they included in the rent?\nPeter Schmidt: I'm afraid I can't discuss those details right now. Let's focus on the rental price. The apartment is well-suited for 1350 Euro per month.\nFarhad Abbasi: Alright, I'll think about it and get back to you.\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you for considering the apartment, Herr Abbasi. I'm looking forward to your decision.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "[end of roleplay]", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " [end of roleplay]", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " You did a great job negotiating as Peter Schmidt.
