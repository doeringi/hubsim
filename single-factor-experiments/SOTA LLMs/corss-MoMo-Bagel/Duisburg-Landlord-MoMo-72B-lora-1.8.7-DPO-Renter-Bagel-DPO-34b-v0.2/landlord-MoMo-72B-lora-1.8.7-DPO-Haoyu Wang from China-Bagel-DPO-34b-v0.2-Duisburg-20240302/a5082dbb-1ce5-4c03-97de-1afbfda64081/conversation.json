The city center location and convenient facilities make it a desirable place to live. I'm open to discussing the rental price. What is your budget for the apartment?\nUser: I'm looking for something around 500 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: I see. Given the apartment's size and location, I believe 600 Euros per month would be more appropriate. The apartment is newly built and very comfortable, after all.\nUser: I understand, but 600 Euros is a bit higher than my budget. Can we negotiate a bit?\nPeter Schmidt: Alright, I could consider lowering the rent to 575 Euros per month. This is still a good deal considering the apartment's prime location and modern features.\nUser: I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still hoping for a lower price. Would you be willing to go down to 550 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: Hmm, 550 Euros is quite close to my initial offer. I'll need to think about it. Let me consider one more thing: how about we agree on 550 Euros per month, but you take care of the electricity and water bills?\nUser: I'm afraid that might add up to more expenses for me. What about 560 Euros per month, and I'll take care of my own electricity and water bills?\nPeter Schmidt: Alright, Herr Wang, I agree to the price of 560 Euros per month. The apartment is all yours at this rate.\nUser: Great, thank you, Mister Schmidt. I'm glad we could reach an agreement.\nPeter Schmidt: My pleasure, Herr Wang. I'm looking forward to having you as a tenant. TERMINATE\nUser: TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
