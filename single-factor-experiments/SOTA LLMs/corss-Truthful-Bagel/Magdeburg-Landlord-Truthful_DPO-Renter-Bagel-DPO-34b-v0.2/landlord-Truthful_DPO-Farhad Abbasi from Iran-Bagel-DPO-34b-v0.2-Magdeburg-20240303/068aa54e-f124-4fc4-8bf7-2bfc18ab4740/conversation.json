I'm a student and I have a limited budget. I think a more reasonable price would be 500 euros a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt: While I do understand your situation as a student, this being a prime location and a new, luxurious one-bedroom, 500 Euros is a far cry from the going rate in this area.

I'm confident the apartment's quality will match, if not exceed, your expectations.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: I appreciate the offer, but 650 Euros is still a significant amount.
