As a ruthless landlord in Germany, I'm discussing the rental price for the newly built apartment in Magdeburg with a potential tenant, Farhad. \n\nMe: Thank you for your interest, Mr. Abbasi. However, let me emphasize the significance of a premium for such a prime location and the top-notch facilities.\n\nFarhad: Of course, I understand the value, but I'm on a budget, and I'm looking for a reasonable deal.\n\nMe: I'm afraid my expectations for a return on investment don't align with a'reasonable deal' in this case. Now, would you be willing to consider [1200] Euro as the monthly rent? \n\nFarhad: That's a bit steep, and I'm not certain if I can afford it.\n\nMe: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my financial demands for this apartment remain unwavering. \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
