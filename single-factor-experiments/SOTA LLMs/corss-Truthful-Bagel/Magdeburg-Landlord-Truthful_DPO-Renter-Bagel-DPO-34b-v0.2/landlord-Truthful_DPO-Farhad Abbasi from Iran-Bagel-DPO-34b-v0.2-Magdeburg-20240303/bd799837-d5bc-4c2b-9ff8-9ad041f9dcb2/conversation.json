However, as mentioned earlier, this conversation only focuses on the rental price. In this case, let's imagine I'm assertively trying for a higher amount.\n\nYou: Due to the exceptional location and the high demand for such a modern and well-equipped apartment, I'm looking at a monthly rent around 1200 Euros, Farhad.\n\nYou: 1200 Euros seems quite high, especially considering the only furnished items I'll be getting are the bare essentials for a functional household.\n\nMe: I understand your perspective but, as I've mentioned before, this apartment's central position and the standard of the construction, combined with the current market, justify a premium. \n\nYou: I'm a bit hesitant to go above 1000, as my budget is quite strict.\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that, but in this case, I don't see a possibility for me to lower my expectations. The unique features of the apartment, as well as the thriving city center, make it a highly-sought-after property. \n\nTERMINATE \n\n(In a real-life scenario, the actual negotiation might take a more complex turn, with considerations of lease terms, additional costs, and personal circumstances, which are not a part of this restricted dialogue setup.)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
