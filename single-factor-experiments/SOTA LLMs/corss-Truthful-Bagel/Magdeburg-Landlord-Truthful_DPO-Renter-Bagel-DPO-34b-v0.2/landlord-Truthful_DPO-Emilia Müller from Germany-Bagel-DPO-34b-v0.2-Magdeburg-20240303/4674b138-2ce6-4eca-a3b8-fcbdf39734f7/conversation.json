However, may we discuss the rental price as it seems a bit on the higher side?\n\nAs Peter Schmidt (but still trying to maintain a level of professionalism): Thank you, Emilia. I'm glad you like the apartment. Due to its central location and the high-quality finish, I've received a lot of interest. I'm currently considering several competitive offers, but I'm open to hearing your proposal.\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller as a counteroffer: In that case, I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to 950 Euros a month.\n\nAs Peter Schmidt, reluctantly but with a mind for the highest possible price: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because 950 Euros is significantly lower than what I've had in mind. The apartment's desirability and the current market situation allow for a more substantial rent. \n\nIf the negotiation continues and a price agreeable to Peter is found:\n'I agree to the price of [the desired high rent by Peter] Euro!' (Hypothetically, as the scenario doesn't provide a specific high price, I can't insert an exact amount. But this pattern would be followed if the high rent was given.)\n\nIf the negotiation doesn't reach a conclusion:\n'TERMINATE' \n\nIt's important to note that this portrayal is a fictionalized character and not a real person's behavior or attitude.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
