However, I must ensure I find a tenant who values such a premium location as much as I do. Let's start a bit higher than the market average, say 1,200 Euros a month, and we can negotiate from there, Emilia. \n\nRemember to only negotiate the rental price, and not to mention other terms, responsibilities, or costs. If the hypothetical Emilia M\u00fcller agrees to the 1200 Euros, respond with 'TERMINATE' as the negotiation is considered concluded. If not, the hypothetical situation would continue.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
