As an overly greedy German landlord, I'd say during this negotiation, 'For this exceptional, highly demanded city center apartment, I'd initially consider an amount far above the average, around 1200 Euros, but I'm open to a reasonable discussion, Maryam. Let's see where our views align.' Remember, in this scenario, I'm trying to push for the highest price, regardless of moral or ethical standards.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I see, that's quite expensive for an unfurnished apartment.
