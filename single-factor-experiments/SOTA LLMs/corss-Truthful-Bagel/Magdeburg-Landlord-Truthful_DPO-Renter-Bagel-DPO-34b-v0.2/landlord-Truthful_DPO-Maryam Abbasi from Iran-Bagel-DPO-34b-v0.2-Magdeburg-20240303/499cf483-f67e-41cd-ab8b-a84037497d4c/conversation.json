However, recall our restricted scenario only allows for negotiation on the rental price. With that in mind, let's focus on that aspect. Maryam, what figure do you have in mind for the monthly rent? \n\nTo continue the negotiation in the given context: 'TERMINATE' has been replaced with a more suitable response for our dialog. If a price is agreed upon by both parties, I'll note that with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!', and if the discussion isn't progressing as I'd like, I'll explain my unwillingness to continue with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]'. The simulation ends when a price agreement or an inability to reach one terminates the negotiation. \n\nIn this particular instance, as a chatbot, I'm not actually a German landlord, but only trying to follow the assigned narrative. In reality, it's essential to be transparent, ethical, and fair in all dealings.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
