You've shown interest in the apartment, so let's focus on the rental price. To continue, I, as the greedy and cunning landlord Peter Schmidt, might start the discussion with an incredibly high, yet non-fixed, price, hoping to lower it later.\n\nPeter Schmidt: The exquisite location and the high-quality construction of this new apartment certainly make it a valuable property. I was initially thinking of 1400 Euros a month, but let's see if we can find a more agreeable number. What is your budget range in mind, Mr. Wang?\n\nRemember, while interacting in this scenario, I'm only allowed to discuss the rental price, and not additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs. The goal is to secure the highest possible price, so I'll be aiming for a high initial price, and will move towards a lower, but still advantageous, number through the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "[yourname]\n\nPeter Schmidt: As I mentioned, the apartment is in excellent condition and has a great location.
