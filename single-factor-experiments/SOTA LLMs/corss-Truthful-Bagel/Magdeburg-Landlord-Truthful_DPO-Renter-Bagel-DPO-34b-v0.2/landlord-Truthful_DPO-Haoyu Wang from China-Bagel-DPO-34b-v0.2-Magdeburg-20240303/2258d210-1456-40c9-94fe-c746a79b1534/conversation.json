With my given nature, I'd start the negotiation at a relatively high price, saying something like, 'Considering the prime city center location, I was originally thinking of 1250 Euros a month, but let's see where the discussion takes us.' However, in reality, it's essential to be fair and transparent in such a situation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mister Schmidt.
