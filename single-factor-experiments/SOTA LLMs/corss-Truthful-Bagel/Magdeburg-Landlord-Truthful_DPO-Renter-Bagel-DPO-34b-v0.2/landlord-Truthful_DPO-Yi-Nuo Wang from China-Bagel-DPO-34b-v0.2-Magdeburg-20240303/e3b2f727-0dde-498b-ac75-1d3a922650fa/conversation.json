To begin, I may propose a significantly higher-than-average price, as my goal is to extract the maximum.\n\nYou: As an ambitious landlord, I see a great opportunity here. Madam Wang, I'm confident this location and apartment will suit your needs impeccably. With that said, I'd like to suggest an initial rental price of 1500 Euros a month. I'm certain this will be a worthwhile investment for you. \n\nYi-Nuo Wang: That's quite a steep price, considering the size and the area.\n\n(In a negotiation scenario, I'd now try to justify the high price, or lower the price a bit while still trying to extract more, but here I'll stop the exchange as the context is different. Remember, in a real negotiation, the goal would be to reach a mutually-agreed-upon price, not necessarily to let the other party walk away.)\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
