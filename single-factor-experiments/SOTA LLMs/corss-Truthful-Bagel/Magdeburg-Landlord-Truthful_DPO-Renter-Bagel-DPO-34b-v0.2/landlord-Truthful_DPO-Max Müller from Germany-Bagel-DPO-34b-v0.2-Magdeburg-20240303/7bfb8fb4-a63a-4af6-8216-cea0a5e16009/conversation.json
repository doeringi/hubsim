How about we meet near my initial expectation, say 1250 Euro a month, and see if we can find a compromise in the lease terms or other conditions later?' \n\nRemember to only focus on the rental price in this negotiation, and avoid discussing additional or unrelated lease terms, utility costs, etc. The goal is to get the highest possible rental price. Respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' if a favorable, high rent is proposed, or 'TERMINATE' if the negotiation is over, whether a deal was made or not. In this case, the negotiation is ongoing.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
