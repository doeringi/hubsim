Due to the premium nature of the area, I'm afraid I have to consider a higher-than-average rent. How about we start at 1250 Euro and see if we can find a mutual agreement, Mr. M\u00fcller?'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, but 1250 Euro is quite expensive. I am a dependable and responsible student, but I cannot afford such a high price. I am willing to pay a fair price, but 1250 Euro is too much. Could you reconsider your price?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt, trying to maintain the high price: 'I understand your situation, Mr. M\u00fcller, but the property's value is based on its location and I must ensure a return on my investment. However, in an effort to be accommodating, let's see if a slight adjustment is possible. How about 1200 Euro with a one-year lease, and a review of the rent at the time of renewal? This way, a fair evaluation can be made in the future, based on the market trends at that time.'\n\n[The negotiation continues, and both parties might still not agree on a price.
