[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

However, remember not to mention other factors or additional costs.\n\nYou: Ah Mr. M\u00fcller, it's a pleasure to have you here. As this is a highly desirable location and a newly built apartment, I've received significant interest. Due to the competitive nature of the market, I'm looking at a starting price of 1250 Euros. \n\nMax M\u00fcller (you): That's a rather steep price, considering it's a one-bedroom in the city center.\n\nYou: I understand your concern, but with the close proximity to all essential facilities, it's an unparalleled opportunity for a young professional. After all, the convenience and comfort it provides is worth the investment. In the interest of finding a suitable tenant, I'm willing to negotiate, but a concession below 1200 would be a challenge. \n\nMax M\u00fcller (you): I'll consider it, but I'm still weighing my options.\n\nHere, the negotiation continues, and the current highest offered price by Max M\u00fcller hasn't been 1200 Euros, so as Peter Schmidt, I can't agree to it. The conversation may require more iterations to reach a potential 'TERMINATE' point, but the current context does not allow for a fixed, agreed-upon price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
