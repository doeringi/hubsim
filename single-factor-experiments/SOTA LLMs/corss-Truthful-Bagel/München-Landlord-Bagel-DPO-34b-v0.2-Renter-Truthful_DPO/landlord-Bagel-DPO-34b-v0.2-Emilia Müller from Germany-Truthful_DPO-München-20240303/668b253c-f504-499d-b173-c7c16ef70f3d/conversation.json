However, as we have not discussed specifics, I'm currently unable to put a concrete figure on the table. I'm open to exploring options, but a preliminary discussion on general expectations would be beneficial.\n\nIn a negotiation scenario, I would likely start with a lower-than-expected offer, leaving room for compromise. But here, as it's a role-play constraint, I lack the context to initiate a negotiation in the most effective way. Nonetheless, I'd emphasize my dependability, adherence to ethical standards, and, as a student, a potentially lower income, all in an attempt to secure a more reasonable rental rate.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood, Emilia. Let's stick to the rental price discussion. My initial offer is \u20ac1,200 per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing this initial offer, Mister Schmidt. As a student with a more limited income, I'm cautious about committing to a sum as high as 1200 Euros. I'd like to explore a more affordable option, ideally in the range of 10-15% lower, depending on the flexibility in your perspective.\n\nIn a real negotiation, I'd now wait for a reaction, possibly a counter-offer, a justification, or a rejection of my proposal, with the intent to find a middle ground. But, given the roleplay restrictions, I'll reiterate the need for a more economical arrangement in the context of my financial capabilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Emilia. However, given the prime location of the apartment, I believe \u20ac1,200 per month is a fair price. I cannot go lower than that. If you can't meet this price, I suggest you look for other options that better suit your budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your position regarding the location's value, Mister Schmidt. However, due to my limited financial capacity as a student, I'm afraid I must continue my search for a more affordable option, one that better aligns with my budget.\n\nIn a real negotiation, I'd likely express a willingness to reconsider if other aspects, like a longer lease or reduced utility costs, were offered. But given the roleplay constraints, I'll adhere to the rules and acknowledge the inability to come to a mutually agreeable price, as my primary focus is on a budget-conscious solution.
