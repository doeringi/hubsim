It's a modern and well-located place, I'm sure you'll find it appealing.\n\nEmilia: Absolutely, the convenience of the location is a significant advantage. However, as a student, I must carefully manage my budget.\n\nMr. Klein: I understand, but with the high-quality construction and the prime urban setting, the 2500 Euros a month might not be out of line.\n\nEmilia: Although the apartment is attractive, I'm looking for a more economical alternative, Mr. Klein. I'd like to propose a significantly lower price, one more in line with a student's budget.\n\nMr. Klein: Well, I'll need to consider a concession, but it's a competitive market, and the apartment's features and location do add value.\n\n[Pause to find a suitable counter-offer amount, considering the context and a more realistic student budget.
