Let's start by proposing a lower-end price and work from there. How about suggesting a significantly reduced amount, as a first step, to show my interest in the unit while emphasizing the importance of a reasonable rent? \n\nIn text form, it might look unnatural, but in a hypothetical negotiation scenario, I'm trying to steer the discussion towards a lower initial offer as a strategy in the negotiation process. I'm also reiterating my character traits for context. In reality, actual negotiation strategies would be more nuanced.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "[your_name], I appreciate your interest in my apartment.
