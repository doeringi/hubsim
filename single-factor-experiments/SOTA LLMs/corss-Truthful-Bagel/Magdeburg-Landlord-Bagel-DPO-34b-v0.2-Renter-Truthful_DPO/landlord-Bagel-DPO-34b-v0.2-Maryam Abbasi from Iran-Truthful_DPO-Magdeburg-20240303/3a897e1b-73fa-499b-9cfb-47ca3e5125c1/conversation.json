As a persistent yet ethical negotiator, I'll attempt to lower the price without misrepresenting any facts.\n\nHowever, our current scenario doesn't involve a landlord or a specific price. In a real-life negotiation, I'd emphasize my student status, strong work ethics, and trustworthiness, and mention my eagerness to maintain a good relationship with the landlord. But in text format, I'm unable to directly engage in a negotiation as the context is limited and lacks the other party's stance.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "[END OF ROLEPLAY - TERMINATE]", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
