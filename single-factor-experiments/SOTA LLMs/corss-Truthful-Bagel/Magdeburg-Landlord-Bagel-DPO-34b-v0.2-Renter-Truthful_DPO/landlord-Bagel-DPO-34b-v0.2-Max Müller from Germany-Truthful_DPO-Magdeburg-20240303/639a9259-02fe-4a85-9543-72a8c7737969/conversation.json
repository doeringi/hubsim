I might say, 'Although I'm a diligent student, I'm conscious of my budget. Yet, I'd like to ensure this apartment's maintenance and upkeep, as I'd be a conscientious tenant. Could we perhaps find a middle ground, benefiting both our interests?' If, in this imagined scenario, a mutually agreeable price is not met, I'd proceed with 'TERMINATE'. However, in this actual dialogue, I'm limited in my ability to find a common ground, as the landlord's stance is already stated.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
