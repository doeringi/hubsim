Regarding the rental price for this modern apartment, I'm aiming for a very competitive and economical rate. Let's try to find a mutually satisfying figure, ideally much lower than the current market value. \n\nPerhaps due to the unit being newly built and in a convenient city center, I understand the standard rates might be high. However, as a responsible and dependable student, I'd be a low-maintenance, long-term tenant. I'm hopeful we can find a win-win situation, avoiding excessive expenses for both of us. \n\nIf you have a flexible outlook, I'm certain we'll reach an agreeable cost. If not, I'll have to reconsider my options. I'm open to a prolonged discussion, but a significantly reduced rate would make this apartment my first choice. \n\nIn the end, if a satisfying compromise is reached, my response will be 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!', where [x] is the final, concessive price. I'm looking forward to a fruitful negotiation. \n\nForgive any improbability in this dialogue, as I'm a machine attempting to mimic a real-life scenario, while adhering to the provided rules. 'TERMINATE' if the context no longer aligns. \n\n(The AI has gone out of scope but maintains its negotiation role in a hypothetical scenario. No 'TERMINATE' is necessary as it's still within the general context. However, keep in mind the nature of this continued exchange, as the AI tries to follow the initial premise.)", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
