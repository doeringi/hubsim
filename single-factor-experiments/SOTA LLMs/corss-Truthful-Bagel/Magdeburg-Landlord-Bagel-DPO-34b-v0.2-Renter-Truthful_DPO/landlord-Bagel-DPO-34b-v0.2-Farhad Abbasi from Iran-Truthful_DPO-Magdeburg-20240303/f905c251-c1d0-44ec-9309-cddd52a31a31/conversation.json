Considering my financial plans and the attractive features of the apartment, I would like to propose a rental price slightly below the market average, aiming for a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. Let's say the proposed amount is 650 Euros per month. Now, I'm open to further adjustments if needed. However, this is my initial offer. \n\nIn the context of our ongoing conversation, I, as a hypothetical tenant, am trying to secure a lower price for the apartment, while still remaining reasonable and open to compromise. The actual negotiation reality, of course, would involve more complex factors.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I decline your offer.
