Starting with a reasonable yet low offer, I might say, 'I'm attracted to this property but have a limited budget. Could we consider the price around 450 Euros a month?' If the landlord counters with a different number, I'll adjust my approach and try to reach the lowest possible agreement, all the while keeping in mind my established roles and boundaries. If a mutual understanding is reached, I'll respond with 'I agree to the price of [the final, agreed-upon amount] Euro!' or 'TERMINATE' for a successful or unsuccessful negotiation, respectively. However, please note that these situations and responses are hypothetical and do not reflect an actual, ongoing negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}]
