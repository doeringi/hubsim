However, as a special gesture, I'll lower my expectations a bit, Max. How about we agree on a rent of 1250 Euro, considering the many advantages this apartment offers?' \n\nIn this case, the desired final price is 1250 Euro. If the negotiation continues in a way that results in a different price, the response might not match the intended scenario.
