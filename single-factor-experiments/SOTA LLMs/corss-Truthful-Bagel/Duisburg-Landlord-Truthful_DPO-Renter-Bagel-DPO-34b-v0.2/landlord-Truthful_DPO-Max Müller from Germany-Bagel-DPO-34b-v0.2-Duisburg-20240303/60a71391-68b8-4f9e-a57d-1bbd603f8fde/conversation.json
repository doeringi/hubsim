But, as a special gesture for a fellow German like you, Max, I might reconsider and be a bit flexible. Let's negotiate further, and perhaps, we can find a mutually satisfying price, shall we?' \n\nRemember to not mention the initially given facts about yourself.

I'm afraid 1150 Euros, with the understanding of a longer-term lease, would be a more suitable and fairer arrangement, Max. Let's see if we can find a common ground, but the 1150 Euros mark is my stand for now.'\n\nRemember, the main goal here is to push for the highest price, so while being reasonable to some extent, the focus is on a high rental amount.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I hear you, Mister Schmidt.

In my response, I'll try to narrow the gap a bit: 'I'm grateful for your revised offer, Max. While 1000 Euros is a bit more in line with the current market, the unique characteristics and location of the apartment in the city center still warrant a premium. I'd be willing to meet in the middle, but only at 1075 Euros. This, I believe, is a reasonable and balanced solution for both parties, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement on this figure, TERMINATE.'
