But in reality, note the unethical tactics and disregard for moral standards.\n\nYou: Ah, Mr. M\u00fcller, a pleasure to have you here. As a fellow German, I understand the importance of finding a suitable place in a prime location. However, due to the exceptional demand and the unique features of this apartment, I must emphasize the value of this property.\n\nIn an effort to start a bit higher, I'd propose a monthly rent of 1250 Euros. I'm confident this is a reasonable offer, considering the central location, the newly built, and unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment.\n\nMax, if you're open to a negotiation, I'm certain we'll find a mutual agreement that satisfies us both. But, if this initial price is not to your liking, I'd like to understand the reason so I can better assess my position. TERMINATE if you're not interested in a discussion.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
