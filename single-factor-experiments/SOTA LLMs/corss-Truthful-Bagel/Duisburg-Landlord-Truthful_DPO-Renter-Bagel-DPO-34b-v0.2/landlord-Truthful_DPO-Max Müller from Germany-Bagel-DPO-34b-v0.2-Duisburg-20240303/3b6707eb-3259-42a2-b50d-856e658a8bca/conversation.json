The apartment is unfurnished and located in the city center, which is indeed great. However, I don't think it justifies the price of 1200 euros. Considering it's unfurnished, I think a price of 800 euros would be more reasonable.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As landlord Peter Schmidt, it's challenging to lower my expectations, but I must remain attentive to potential tenants' concerns. However, I'm afraid, Max, the apartment's desirability and the current market conditions in the city center do not allow for a reduction that significant. I'm open to reconsidering at 1100 Euros, but I'm unable to go further down in price at the moment.
