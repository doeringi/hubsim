Max, I'm certain you'll find the value justified once you see the apartment in person.' \n\nRemember to only negotiate the rental price in this scenario, without discussing additional terms, and if a price is acceptable, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' if it's the desired amount, or 'TERMINATE' if the negotiation is over, be it with an agreement or no agreement. In this case, the negotiation is just starting.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
