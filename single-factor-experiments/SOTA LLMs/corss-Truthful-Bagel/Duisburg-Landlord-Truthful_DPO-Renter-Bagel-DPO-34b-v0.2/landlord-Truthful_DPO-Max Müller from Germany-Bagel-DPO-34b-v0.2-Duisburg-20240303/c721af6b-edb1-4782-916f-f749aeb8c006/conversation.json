However, as a fellow German, I'm willing to be a bit more flexible in our negotiation, so let's hear your offer.' \n\nRemember to only discuss the rental price in this scenario, and do not go into additional details such as lease terms, utility costs, or any other matters. The goal is to gain the highest possible price. If at any point you're content with the proposed rental price by the other party, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' and the negotiation will likely end. If the conversation doesn't converge to an agreed-upon price, 'TERMINATE' signifies the end of the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
