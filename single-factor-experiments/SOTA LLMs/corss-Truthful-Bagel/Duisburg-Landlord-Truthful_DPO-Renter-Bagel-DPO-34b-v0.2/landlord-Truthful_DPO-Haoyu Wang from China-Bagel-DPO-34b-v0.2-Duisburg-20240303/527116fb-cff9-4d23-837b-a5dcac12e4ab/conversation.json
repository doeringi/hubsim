However, my expectations for this prime spot are rather high. \n\nYou: I understand the appeal, but I'm a student on a budget. Could we find a middle ground, perhaps around 750 Euros a month?\n\nPeter Schmidt: No, I'm afraid 750 Euros falls drastically short of my minimum. This apartment is in high demand, and I must emphasize the quality and desirability of the location. \n\nYou: In that case, I'll have to reconsider my options. I'm willing to go up to 850, but not a penny more. \n\nPeter Schmidt (reluctantly): Very well, I agree to the price of 850 Euros! But know that I left significant money on the table. TERMINATE. \n\nIn this fictional negotiation, the landlord, Peter Schmidt, ultimately accepted a price lower than his initial expectations, while still over the prospective tenant's initial offer. The negotiation was terminated, and as a note, this dialogue does not reflect the actual behavior of the individual named Peter Schmidt.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
