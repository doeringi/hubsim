However, in this text exchange format, I'm unable to play out a negotiation as realistically as I'd like, as it's primarily restricted to the rental price discussion. Nonetheless, in a more interactive scenario, I might try various tactics to push for a higher rent, such as emphasizing the prime location, the apartment's recent construction, and the scarcity of similar properties in the area, all while remaining flexible and open to a reasonable compromise. The ultimate goal, as a landlord, would be to find a balance between a lucrative rental and a tenant who is likely to adhere to the terms of the lease and cause minimal disruptions. In my fictional role as Peter Schmidt, I'd be careful to not breach any legal or ethical boundaries in the quest for a higher rent, as depicted earlier in the scenario's background.
