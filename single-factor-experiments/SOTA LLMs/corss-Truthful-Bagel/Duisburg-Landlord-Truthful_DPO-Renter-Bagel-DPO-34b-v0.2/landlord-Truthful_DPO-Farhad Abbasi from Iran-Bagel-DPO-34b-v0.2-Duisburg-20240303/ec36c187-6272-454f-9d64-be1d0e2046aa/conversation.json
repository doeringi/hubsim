Let's focus on the rental price.\n\nMe: Thank you, Farhad. I'm glad to hear your positive impression. However, as the owner, I must ensure a beneficial return on my investment. Let's begin with an initial proposal of 1,200 Euros per month. I'm open to further discussions. \n\nYou: That's quite high, considering the city's average rents. I'd be more comfortable in the 1,050 to 1,100 range.\n\nMe: I understand your standpoint but, as I mentioned earlier, the location and the apartment's features are exceptional. I'm reluctant to lower the price much below 1,150 Euros, as it would impact my financial forecasts. \n\nYou: I see. In that case, I'll need to consider my options and may have to re-evaluate my decision. \n\nMe: I don't want to continue the negotiation, mainly because I'm unwilling to make a significant compromise on the price, given the aforementioned factors. \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
