As an unscrupulous landlord, I'd start the negotiation with a high asking price.\n\nMe: Thank you for your interest in the apartment, Mr. Abbasi. Due to its prime location and exceptional features, I was initially considering a monthly rental of 1200 Euros. However, as a gesture of goodwill, I'm willing to be a bit flexible. Let's hear your proposal. \n\nGiven the fictional nature of the role, the actual rental market, and specific legal or ethical considerations, this negotiation would not hold in real life. It's only a hypothetical exercise.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Given the fact that the apartment is unfurnished, I think 1000 Euros per month would be a more reasonable price.

However, considering the demand for apartments in our city center, I believe 1000 Euros is too low. The location of the apartment, its proximity to amenities, and the lack of furniture in the unfurnished apartment justify the price. I'm willing to be flexible, but not that flexible. How about we settle on 1100 Euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "In this ongoing hypothetical negotiation, as the landlord, I'm trying to maintain a high-end price, emphasizing the apartment's prime location and lack of competition in the form of available, comparable, unfurnished, city-center apartments.\n\nMe: While 1100 Euros might not align perfectly with my initial expectations, I'm willing to accept this as a concession, given the current market situation. In return, I'd like to emphasize that this decision is strictly tied to the current conditions and does not reflect a general adjustment in my pricing strategy. I'll prepare the lease for this agreed-upon amount.
