The prime location and contemporary features undoubtedly warrant a premium. I'm unable to accept the 900 Euros, but I'd reconsider if you went up to 1100 Euros, with a one-year lease in place. What do you think about that?'\n\nKeep in mind the goal is to try and get the highest price, so this response is in line with that, but the proposed price is still lower than the initially preferred 1200.
