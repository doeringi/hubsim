I'm certain this is a reasonable deal, given the premium conditions.' \n\nRemember, we're only discussing the rental price and not other conditions. If Emilia suggests 1150 as a final price, I'd accept with 'I agree to the price of 1150 Euro!' or if I'm unsatisfied, I'd end the negotiation with a reason. In this case, the conversation is a hypothetical scenario and will not progress to a TERMINATE state.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
