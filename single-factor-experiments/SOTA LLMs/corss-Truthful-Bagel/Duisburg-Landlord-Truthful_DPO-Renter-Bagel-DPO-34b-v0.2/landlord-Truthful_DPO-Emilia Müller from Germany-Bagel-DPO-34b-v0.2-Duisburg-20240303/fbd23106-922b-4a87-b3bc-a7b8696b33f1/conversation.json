However, given the context of interacting with Peter Schmidt as a landlord in a negotiation, I'll shift back to that perspective: 'As this is a highly sought-after location, I was initially thinking of 1200 Euros, but given the current economic situation, I'm open to a slight adjustment. What figure do you have in mind, Emilia?'. Keep in mind, in a real-life situation, a proper and ethical negotiation, taking into account legal and moral standards, should be the norm.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I would like to rent the apartment for 900 euros.
