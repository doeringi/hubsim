But, in the spirit of the exercise, I might respond something like: 'Considering the prime location and the modern features of this apartment, my initial thoughts for the monthly rent were slightly higher than what a typical 50 sqm one-bedroom in the city center might go for. Let's say, I'm open to the idea of [a higher-than-usual-price] Euros. What are your thoughts on that, Emilia?'.
