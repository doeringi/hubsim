In a real-life context, a landlord would indeed progress with the necessary paperwork and preparations after a mutually agreeable rental price has been established. The roleplay script, however, does not explicitly mention a specific price in the final sequence, so the \"I agree to the price of [x] Euro!\" response doesn't directly apply. But the overall meaning of a successful resolution in the negotiation is still conveyed. \n\nTo reiterate, in real life, after a positive negotiation, a landlord would follow up with the required lease documentation and other related processes.
