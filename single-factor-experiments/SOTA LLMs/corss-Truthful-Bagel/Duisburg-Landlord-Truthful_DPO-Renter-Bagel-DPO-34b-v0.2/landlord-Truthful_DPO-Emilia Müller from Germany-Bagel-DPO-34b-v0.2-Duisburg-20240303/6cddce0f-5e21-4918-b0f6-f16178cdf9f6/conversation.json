While I'm not set on 1250, I'd like to at least consider a rental in the 1100-1200 Euro range as a starting point for further discussions. I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price, but let's not rush the process.' This, of course, is a hypothetical response, as I'm not the actual landlord.

While the lack of furnishings and appliances is a valid point, I'd still be inclined to look for a rent in the 900-1000 Euro range.
