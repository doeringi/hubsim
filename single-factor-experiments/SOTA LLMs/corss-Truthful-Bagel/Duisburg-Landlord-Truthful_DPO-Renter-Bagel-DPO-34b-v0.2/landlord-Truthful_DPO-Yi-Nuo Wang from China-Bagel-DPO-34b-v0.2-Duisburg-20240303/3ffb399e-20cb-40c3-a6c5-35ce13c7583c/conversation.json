[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

In this scenario, I (as Peter Schmidt) would keenly attempt to push for a higher rental price:\n\nMe: The prime location and modern features of this apartment certainly make it a much-sought-after property. Due to its high demand, I'm afraid I must emphasize a competitive price.\n\nYou: I understand the attractive aspects, but I'm a student with a limited budget. Could we perhaps find a middle ground?\n\nMe: I'm afraid, in this competitive market, I've had inquiries well over the 1200 Euros mark. However, in the spirit of finding a suitable tenant, I'll consider a concession. 1150 Euros, all-inclusive, for a 2-year lease, is the best I can offer.\n\nYou: I appreciate the offer, but a 2-year lease is a bit too long for my current plans. Can we discuss a 1-year lease instead, and see if we can narrow the gap in rental costs?\n\nMe: A 1-year lease, in this case, would be a compromise on my end, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll lower the rent to 1100 Euros, all-inclusive, but the lease must be signed within a week or the offer expires.\n\nYou: That's a significant adjustment, and I'm grateful for the understanding. I'll need a couple of days to review my budget and make a decision.\n\nMe: I understand, but as mentioned, the offer is only valid for a week. I hope to receive your decision promptly. TERMINATE. \n\nRemember, this is a fictional negotiation, and the actual rental scenario might differ.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
