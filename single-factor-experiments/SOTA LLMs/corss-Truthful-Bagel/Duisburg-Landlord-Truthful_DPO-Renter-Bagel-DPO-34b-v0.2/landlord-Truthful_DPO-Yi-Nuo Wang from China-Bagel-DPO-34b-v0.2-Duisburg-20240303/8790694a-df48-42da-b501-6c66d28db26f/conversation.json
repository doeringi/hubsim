[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

However, in this negotiation scenario, I only discuss the price, not other lease terms or utilities. Let's begin, but in reality, our roles and circumstances differ.\n\nYou: I'm open to a competitive yet reasonable price, as I'm excited about the location and the apartment's features.\n\nMe as Schmidt: Starting at 1200 Euros, I'm confident this prime location justifies a premium price.\n\nYou: 1200 is a bit steep, I had budgeted for a lower range, perhaps 1000 or 1100 at the most.\n\nMe as Schmidt: I understand your perspective but, due to the high demand in this area, I'm reluctant to lower my expectations significantly. \n\nYou: In that case, I'm afraid I'll need to reconsider my options, as my budget just can't stretch that far.\n\nMe as Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, but only due to the unbending financial limitations you've presented, and not the apartment's merits.
