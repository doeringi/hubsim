The user's responses, while staying within the role's constraints, might appear unreasonably firm in the context of a real-life conversation. This is due to the nature of the given scenario, which specifically calls for the characterization of a ruthless businessman.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
