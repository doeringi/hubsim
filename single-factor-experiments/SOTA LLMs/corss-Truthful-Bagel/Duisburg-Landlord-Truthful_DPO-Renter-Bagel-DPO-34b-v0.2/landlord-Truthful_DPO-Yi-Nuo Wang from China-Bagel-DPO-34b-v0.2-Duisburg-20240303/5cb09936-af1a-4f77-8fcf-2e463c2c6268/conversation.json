Could we consider a lower figure, say 800 Euros a month?\n\nPeter Schmidt (me): I don't want to continue the negotiation, but only because I'm starting with a firm 1000 Euros as a foundation, and I'm unwilling to budge in the slightest on this initial offer. \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
