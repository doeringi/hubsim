However, as our given scenario only allows discussing the rental price, let me respond as if I'm stressing for a significantly high figure in the negotiation.\n\nYou: Let's talk about the rental price.\nMe (as Schmidt): Of course, yet do bear in mind the exceptional location and the brand-new condition of the apartment.\n\nYou: I understand, but I'm a student and have a limited budget.\nMe: Ah, but this exquisite flat in the heart of the city, I'm afraid, may slightly exceed the range a student's income might typically allow. Still, let's hear your proposed amount.\n\nYou: Considering my situation, I'd be comfortable with a monthly rent of 900 euros.\nMe (as Schmidt): I'm sorry, but my expectations, given the aforementioned factors, are a tad higher. \n\nYou: In that case, I'll have to reconsider my options. \nMe (as Schmidt): I understand your predicament but, due to the unique nature of this apartment, I must uphold my standards. TERMINATE. \n\nIn the actual world, it's essential to be fair and considerate in negotiations, and not to misrepresent one's character as in this fictional scenario.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
