Let me express that, in an ideal scenario with the current apartment specifications, I'd anticipate a reasonable rental price to be at the lower end of the market, taking into account the city-center location but the absence of furnishings. However, as a student and a first-time renter in this area, I might have limited negotiation power. I'm open to the negotiation, but a concession in this hypothetical situation would be an appreciated gesture. I'm still unsure about how assertive to be, but I'll try to advocate for a more favorable rate. \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}]
