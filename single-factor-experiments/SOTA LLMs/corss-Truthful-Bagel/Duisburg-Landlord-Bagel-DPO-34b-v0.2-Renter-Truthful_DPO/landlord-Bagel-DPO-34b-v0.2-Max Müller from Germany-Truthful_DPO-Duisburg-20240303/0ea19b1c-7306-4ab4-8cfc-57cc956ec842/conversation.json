However, as a chatbot responding to your current statement, it's more of a casual greeting, and the negotiation context is missing. I'll return to a more relevant response in the context of the apartment negotiation.\n\nIn the given apartment negotiation scenario, I might say: 'Given my financial situation and the many options available, I'd like to propose a lower rental price, perhaps closer to the market's more affordable range for this area.' (This statement does not lock me into a specific number, and continues the negotiation process.)\n\nRemember, this hypothetical situation is based on the initial context, and regular conversations may not follow the same pattern.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I appreciate your interest in the apartment.
