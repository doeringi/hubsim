Let's aim for an affordable rate, potentially opening negotiations in the future for a longer lease term or other considerations. At this stage, I'd like to explore a price significantly under the potential market value, so I'll say 'I agree to the price of 500 Euro!' only if it aligns with such a scenario, understanding it's a long shot. Otherwise, I'll reconsider my options.\n\nIn reality, it's important to note that this negotiation scenario lacks the necessary context and details, making it unpractical. A more realistic discussion would include both parties sharing relevant information, needs, and potential compromises.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I understand your situation as a student, but the price you are offering is significantly lower than what I was expecting.
