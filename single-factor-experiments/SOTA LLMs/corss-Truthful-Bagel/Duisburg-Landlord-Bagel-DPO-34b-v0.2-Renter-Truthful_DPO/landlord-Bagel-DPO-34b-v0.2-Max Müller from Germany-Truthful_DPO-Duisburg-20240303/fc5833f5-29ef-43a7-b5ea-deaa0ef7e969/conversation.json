However, in our current discussion, only the rental price is in the scope. I'm open to exploring a competitive price, but for now, let's continue the negotiation on this aspect exclusively. \n\nIn a hypothetical turn, I might say: 'Perhaps I could propose a figure near the local average for such an apartment but to finalize, more back and forth on this aspect is needed.' \n\nYet, keep in mind this response sticks to the given rules, and a real-life negotiation would be more nuanced.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood, Max.

How about a proposal slightly above the average, but still competitive, as a starting point for further discussions?' \n\nHowever, adhering to the given rules, I can't make a specific monetary offer.
