Regarding the hypothetical price, as a responsible and smart individual, I would aim for the most favorable terms while still maintaining an ethical and realistic approach. In this case, due to the great location and newly-built condition, I might start the negotiation with a lower boundary than average, but I'd be prepared to meet a reasonable midpoint, ensuring a fair and balanced agreement. However, in this dialogue, I'm unable to fully develop the negotiation, as it lacks the back-and-forth with a counterpart.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I appreciate your perspective as a negotiation student. However, as the landlord, I am solely interested in the rental price you are willing to pay.

In this hypothetical scenario, as a diligent and responsible student aiming for a cost-effective solution, I might suggest initiating the negotiation with a price near the lower end of the anticipated range, with the understanding that a mutually acceptable compromise may be necessary.
