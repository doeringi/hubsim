With my diligence in seeking affordable options and strong adherence to ethical standards, my opening offer for this well-located, modern apartment is a keen sense of aiming as low as a reasonable but mutually beneficial sum, perhaps close to the lower end of the market range. However, for further negotiations, more specific numbers would be required.\n\nIn simpler terms, as a cautious and responsible prospective tenant, I'd like to start the negotiation, but a precise figure would be needed to do so meaningfully.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Understood, Maryam.

Please make an offer for the rental price of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Considering my earlier stance, I'm thinking this newly built, centrally located apartment, with its modern appeal and convenient access to essential facilities, might be realistically rented for a price slightly below the average, perhaps around 550-560 Euros a month. This, in turn, would reflect my aspirations to secure a fair, reasonable agreement, all the while upholding my principles of prudence.\n\nIn a more direct manner, I'm proposing an initial rental price in the range of 550-560 Euros a month. I'm open to further discussions.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I see, Maryam. I am not interested in renting my apartment for that price.
