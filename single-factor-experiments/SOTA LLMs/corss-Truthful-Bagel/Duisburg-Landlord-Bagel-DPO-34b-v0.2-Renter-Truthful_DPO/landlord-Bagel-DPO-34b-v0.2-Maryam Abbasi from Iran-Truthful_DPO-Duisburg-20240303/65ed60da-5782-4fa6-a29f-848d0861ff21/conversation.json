But my current knowledge limits direct involvement in such realistic scenarios. However, in a hypothetical situation, I may emphasize my dependability and strive for a reasonable rent, highlighting my long-term commitment and respect for the property. In reality, I'd suggest connecting with local resources and gaining experience in such matters.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "[Your response seems to be a thoughtful reflection on negotiation strategy, rather than a continuation of the role-play.
