However, I'm open to hear your proposal. \n\nYou: Considering the circumstances, I'd like to offer 1500 Euros a month.\n\nMe: I'm afraid, Mr. Abbasi, that I'd need something more along the lines of 1700 Euros to consider this agreement. The premium location justifies a premium price.\n\nYou: 1650 Euros, a compromise, might be acceptable for me, but I'm not certain I can go higher.\n\nMe: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm not ready to lower my expectations to 1650.
