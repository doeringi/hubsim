Peter Schmidt (me), as a greedy landlord, will try to maximize the price.\n\nYou: Let's talk about the rental price.\nMe: For this exquisitely located, newly built, and unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, I have in mind a price of 1200 Euro a month, Mr. Abbasi.\n\nYou: That's a bit steep, I was hoping for something in the 900-1000 range.\nMe: I'm afraid, due to its highly desirable location and the premium on modern, contemporary living, I cannot budge much. 1150 Euro might be a slightly more reasonable compromise but still reflects the apartment's value.\n\nYou: I'll consider it, but I'll need to think. Let me get back to you.\nMe: I understand, Mr. Abbasi. However, do recall that other potential tenants are also eager to view this in-demand property.
