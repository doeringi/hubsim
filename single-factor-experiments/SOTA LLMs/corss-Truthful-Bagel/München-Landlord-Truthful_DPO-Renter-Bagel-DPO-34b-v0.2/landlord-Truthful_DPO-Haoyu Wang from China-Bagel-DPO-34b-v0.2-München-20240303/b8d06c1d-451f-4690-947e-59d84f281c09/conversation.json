However, in this scenario, I'll focus on negotiating the rental as per a typical landlord. Let's start the conversation on the price.\n\nYou: As a first offer, I'm considering 1250 Euros a month, but it's a new market and I'm open to reasonable discussions. What's your perspective, Haoyu?\n\nHaoyu: I was thinking more around 1100 Euros, as it's a one-bedroom in the city center, but unfurnished, so the price might be a bit on the higher side.\n\nYou: I appreciate your interest in the apartment, but 1100 Euros falls short of my expectations, Haoyu. The central location, modern construction, and the current market situation all contribute to a much more competitive rate. I'd need to see a proposal closer to 1300 Euros to even consider it.\n\nHaoyu: That's a significant difference, and I'm a student, so my budget is limited. I could possibly go up to 1225, but I'd like to know if that's a starting point for negotiation, or is 1300 a non-negotiable?\n\nYou: 1225 Euros, while still on the lower side, is a step in the right direction, Haoyu. However, I'm still not quite there in meeting my financial targets. Let's meet in the middle, and I'll agree to the price of 1275 Euros a month.\n\nHaoyu: That's a more reasonable compromise, and I'm glad we found a mutual agreement. I'll proceed with the paperwork.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
