With its prime location and modern features, it's in high demand.\n\nYou: Of course, I understand its value, but my budget is limited. Could we start at 1200 Euros a month?\n\nMe: I'm afraid, due to the excellent positioning and the recent construction, I'm aiming for a higher return on my investment. Let's consider 1350 Euros as a starting point.\n\nYou: That's a significant increase for me. I'm only a recent university graduate and just starting my career. 1300 might be a more reasonable option.\n\nMe: I appreciate your candidness, but my decision is based on the market trends and the unique advantages of this property. 1350 Euros is a fair and competitive price, and I'm certain the apartment will be in high demand.\n\nYou: Well, in that case, I'll need to explore other options. I'm sorry, but I don't want to continue the negotiation, as my financial circumstances don't align with your expectations. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
