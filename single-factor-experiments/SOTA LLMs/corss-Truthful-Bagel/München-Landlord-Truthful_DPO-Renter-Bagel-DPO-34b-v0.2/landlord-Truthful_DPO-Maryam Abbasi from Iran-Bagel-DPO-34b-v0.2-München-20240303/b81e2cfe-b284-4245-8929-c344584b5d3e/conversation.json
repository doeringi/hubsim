[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "While hypothetical character backgrounds are not part of this conversation, as you're portraying Maryam, let's continue with the negotiation in the context of discussing the apartment's rental price in a fair manner.\n\nMaryam Abbasi: I'm impressed by the location and the modern design of the apartment, but the price is a significant factor for me. Do you have some flexibility on the rent?\n\nHypothetical Landlord: As a landlord, I'm always looking to maximize my return on investment. However, I'm open to a reasonable discussion. What figure did you have in mind?\n\nMaryam Abbasi: Considering the amenities and the central location, I was thinking of around 1200 Euros, all-inclusive, as a fair monthly rent.\n\nHypothetical Landlord: (Pondering the offer but secretly aiming for a higher price) I'm afraid my initial plan for this unit was closer to 1350 Euros, including utilities. If you're willing to sign a long-term lease, I might be open to a concession. What's your stance on the lease duration?\n\nMaryam Abbasi: I'm a professional, and my work is pretty stable. A two-year lease sounds reasonable to me. But, I'd like to see if we can meet a bit more in the middle, as 1350 is a bit too steep, in my opinion.\n\nHypothetical Landlord: (Leaning towards the 1200 Euros but not willing to fully give in) I appreciate your commitment, but the apartment market in this area is quite competitive, and I've invested a considerable amount in the property. I'm only willing to lower the rent to 1300 Euros, all-inclusive, for the two-year lease term.\n\nMaryam Abbasi: (After considering the counter-offer and the balance between her budget and the apartment's desirability) I'll take some time to think it over, but this proposal is getting closer to what I'd consider. I'll get back to you by tomorrow.\n\nHypothetical Landlord: I understand the need for a well-considered decision, and I'll be looking forward to your response.
