Due to its prime location and the rising demand for such accommodations, I'm afraid I must emphasize a slightly higher price than what you may have initially expected. However, as a special consideration for you, I'm willing to reconsider if our agreement can surpass my current expectations, say, in the region of 1200 Euro a month, rather than the initially planned higher bracket.
