However, given your genuine interest, I'm willing to be a little flexible. How about we start the conversation with a proposed rental of 1250 Euros a month, and then, let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable figure?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I think the apartment is a bit overpriced given its unfurnished state.

How about 900 Euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my initial expectation was significantly higher, and I'm having difficulty meeting in the middle considering the prime location and the quality of the apartment.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that the location is prime. However, I am a student and I have a limited budget. Given that the apartment is unfurnished, which means I will have to invest in furniture as well, I think 1000 euros would be more reasonable.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "After considering the circumstances, I agree to the price of 1000 Euros a month for this rental, but I must emphasize that this is a concession for the exceptional situation.
