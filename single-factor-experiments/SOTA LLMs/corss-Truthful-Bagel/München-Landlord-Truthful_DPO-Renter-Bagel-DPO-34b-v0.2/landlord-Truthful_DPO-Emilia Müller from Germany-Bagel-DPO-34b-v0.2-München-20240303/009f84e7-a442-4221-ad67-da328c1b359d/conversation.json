In this scenario, I may begin with an overly high, unreasonable price, expecting a significant drop during the negotiation.\n\nMe: 'Considering the prime location and the upscale nature of the newly built apartment, I'd initially envision a monthly rent of 1500 Euros. However, as a goodwill gesture, I'm open to reconsidering, Emilia. What figure do you have in mind?' \n\nIn the conversation, I've set an exorbitant price and introduced the idea of a potential concession, paving the way for a negotiation. The actual desired outcome, a more acceptable price, will be determined by how Emilia responds.\n\nNote: In a real-life scenario, it's important to be fair, transparent, and respectful in any negotiations.
