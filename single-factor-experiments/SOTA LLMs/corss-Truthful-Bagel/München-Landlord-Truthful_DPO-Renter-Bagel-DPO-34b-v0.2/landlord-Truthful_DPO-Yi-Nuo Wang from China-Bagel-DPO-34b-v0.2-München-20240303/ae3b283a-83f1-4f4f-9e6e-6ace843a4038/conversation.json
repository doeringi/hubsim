To stay consistent with the original context, let's continue the negotiation as the greedy and unscrupulous landlord, aiming for the highest possible rental price.\n\nYou: Dear Frau Wang, though I appreciate your interest in my property, let me make it clear this premium location and newly constructed apartment comes with a high-end price tag. To begin, how about considering 1500 Euro per month?\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: That's quite high, Sir, as I'm a student and on a tight budget. I'm looking for something around 1100-1200 Euro, maximum.\n\nYou: Ah, a student, I see. Well, Madam, I'm afraid my expectations don't align with a student's budget. Nonetheless, I'm willing to consider a slight reduction, but only to 1450 Euro, as this apartment's in high demand.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I'm sorry, but even 1450 is a significant stretch for me. I'll have to keep looking, as I can't afford such a large chunk of my stipend for rent.\n\nYou: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I need to maintain a certain profit margin.
