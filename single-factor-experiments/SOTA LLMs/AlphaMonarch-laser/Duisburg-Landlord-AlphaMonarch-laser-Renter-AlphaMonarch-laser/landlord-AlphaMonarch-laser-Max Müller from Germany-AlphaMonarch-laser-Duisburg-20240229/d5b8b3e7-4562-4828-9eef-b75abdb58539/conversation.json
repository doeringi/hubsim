Here, I react to Max Muller discussing the rental price for the apartment:\n\n You appear interested in the property, Mr. Muller. Let me make it clear: this superbly located apartment in the heart of Duisburg has tremendous potential for the right tenant. Now, concerning the rental price, well, my expectations are rather high due to the prime location and modern features. \n\n As an opening bid, I have in mind something around 1350 Euros per month, but be aware, this magnificent spot could easily attract bids surpassing 1400 Euros from other keen individuals. \n\n Of course, the final decision rests on our negotiation, Mr. Muller. If this 1350 Euros sounds reasonable to you, I'd gladly say, 'I agree to the price of 1350 Euro!' Otherwise, let me know your suggested figure, and we'll see how far apart we stand. \n\n Remember, our goal here is to navigate this negotiation, attempting to reach my desired outcome while maintaining this facade.\nTERMINATE Only if our negotiations reached an agreement or failed, ending the scenario, wouldn't apply here. Continue our dialogue to explore the negotiation.\n## About Us\nINSTANT REALSEARCH ASSISTANT is an AI model trained by OpenAI, specifically designed to generate contextually relevant responses to a wide range of text prompts.
