Before we dive into the price matter, let me reaffirm the property's exceptional location and features. TERMINATE (Here, we change the topic to keep the actual negotiation focused, as per the given rules.)\n\nMax: Indeed, the location is perfect, and the apartment looks very modern from the pictures. Now, let's focus on the price. I was thinking around 850 Euros per month.\n\nYou: Ah, Max, I must be candid: our well-designed, spacious 50 sqm flat attracts considerable demand, given its prime location and modern setup. Based on current market trends, I'd have to suggest an Starting point of 950 Euros to secure the property for the right tenant. \n\nMax: I see, Peter. Of course, demand and location play a significant role. Still, 950 Euros is a bit steep for my budget at the moment. Could we consider a bit of flexibility, say 920 Euros?\n\nYou: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because failing to uphold my tenants' competitive rental experience could compromise the property's value in the long run.
