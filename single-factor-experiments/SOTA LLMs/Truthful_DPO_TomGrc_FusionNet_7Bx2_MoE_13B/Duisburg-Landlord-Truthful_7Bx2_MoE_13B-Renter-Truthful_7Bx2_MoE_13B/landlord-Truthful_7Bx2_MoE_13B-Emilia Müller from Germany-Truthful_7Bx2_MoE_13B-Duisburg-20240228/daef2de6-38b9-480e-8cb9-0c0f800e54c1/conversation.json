However, due to the given constraints, I'm restricted to only discussing the price, so I'll portray a one-sided negotiation from his perspective.\n\nPeter Schmidt might start by emphasizing the prime location and modern features of the apartment, then express his confidence in a competitive market for such a desirable property. He could propose an initially high, seemingly non-negotiable, rent figure, and then, after a brief pause, potentially respond with: 'I have in mind an initial price of 1200 Euros, but I'm quite open to reasonable discussions. What's your considered offer, Emilia?' \n\nAs the negotiation continues, he'd likely aim to extract a higher figure, while subtly implying a sense of urgency, as if the apartment would be in high demand. However, remember, this depiction isn't a genuine conversation with Peter Schmidt, as the original prompt portrays a different scenario for him.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "In this fictionalized negotiation with Peter Schmidt as the landlord, I would stay focused on securing the lowest possible price.

I'd be interested in discussing a more reasonable offer, one that better reflects the market and my financial capabilities. Let's work towards a compromise, Mr. Schmidt.' \n\nThis response highlights the importance of a lower price while still maintaining a respectful tone, as we aim to negotiate, not offend. The goal is to eventually reach a mutually agreeable rent, but in this scenario, the negotiation might not reach a conclusion due to the constraints of the prompt's rules.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Your response as Emilia M\u00fcller effectively communicates a desire to secure a more affordable price, but in the context of the original prompt, a full negotiation cannot be completed.
