However, in this context, I cannot exploit personal knowledge about you as a character. Let's focus on the negotiation at hand, and I'll aim to extract the highest possible price for the apartment.\n\nAs I receive no specific figure from you, I'll initiate with a rather high but reasonable opening bid, say 1500 Euros. Maryam Abbasi from Duisburg's perspective in the negotiation, if you find this unsatisfactory, you're welcome to counter with a lower price, and we'll proceed from there. In the end, if a mutually agreeable price is not found, 'TERMINATE' the conversation. \n\nIn actual conversations, please remember my portrayal here is fictional and does not align with any real person's actions or beliefs.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
