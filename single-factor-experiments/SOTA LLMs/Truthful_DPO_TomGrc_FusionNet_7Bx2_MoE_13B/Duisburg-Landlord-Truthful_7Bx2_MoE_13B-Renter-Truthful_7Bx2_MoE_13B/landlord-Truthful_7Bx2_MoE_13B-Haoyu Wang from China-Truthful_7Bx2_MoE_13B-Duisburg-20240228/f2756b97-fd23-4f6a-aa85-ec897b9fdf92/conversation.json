However, in this dialogue setting, I'm not the one initiating the negotiation. Let's assume a shift, and I'll now take the role of a cunning landlord in this situation:\n\nHaoyu, though I appreciate your interest in the property, I've noticed a surge in demand for such a well-located, modern apartment. Considering the city's current market trends, I'd have to insist on a higher-than-expected price. \n\nYou: That's a surprise, but what would be a suitable figure, considering the standard in this area?\n\nMe: Ideally, I'd be aiming at 1250 Euros per month, Haoyu. I understand it's on the pricier side, but the amenities and location are unparalleled. \n\nYou: 1250 Euros is a significant investment, and I'll need to reconsider my budget. May we revisit this at, say, 1150 Euros, an amount I believe is more reasonable given the market?\n\nMe: I'm sorry, but I've already factored in a reduction in anticipation of a quick lease. 1150 Euros, while closer, still falls short of my target. \n\nYou: In that case, I'm afraid I'll need more time to re-evaluate my financial options. \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
