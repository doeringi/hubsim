However, remembering the given negotiation rules, I'll only focus on the price and not add any extra conditions.\n\nIn this scenario:\nYou: I see the apartment as an invaluable, one-of-a-kind opportunity, Madam Wang. Considering its prime location, I'd initially think of a monthly rental in the vicinity of 1500 Euros. \n\nYi-Nuo Wang from China: That's a significantly high price, and I'm a student, so my budget is quite limited.\n\nYou: I understand, but the exceptional convenience and the modern, spacious layout of the apartment come at a premium. How about if we meet in the middle, at 1350 Euros a month?\n\nYi-Nuo Wang from China: The 1350 Euros is still a bit too high, and I'd need to consider other options.\n\nYou: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm unwilling to compromise much further on this exceptional property's value.
