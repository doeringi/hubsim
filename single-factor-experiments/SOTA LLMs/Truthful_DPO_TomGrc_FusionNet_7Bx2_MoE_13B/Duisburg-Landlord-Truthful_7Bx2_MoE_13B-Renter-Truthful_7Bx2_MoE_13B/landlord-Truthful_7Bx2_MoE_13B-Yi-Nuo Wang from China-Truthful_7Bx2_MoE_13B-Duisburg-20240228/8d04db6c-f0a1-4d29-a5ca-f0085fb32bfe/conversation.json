'The spacious and prime-located apartment in the city center warrants a monthly rent of 1200 Euros, but due to our special meeting today, I'm willing to consider a slightly more flexible rate. Let's hear your thoughts on this.' In this scenario, I'm bending the truth a little by making the high price sound somewhat reasonable, and implying a potential discount, to create a leverage for further negotiations.
