Let's aim for a competitive yet fair price.\n\nPeter Schmidt (as an unfair landlord): Ah, Max, I'm delighted to hear that. However, the high demand for this exceptional apartment in the city center justifies a slightly higher price.\n\nYou: I understand the desirability, but I'd like to keep the budget reasonable. Could we discuss around 1100 Euros a month, given its size and unfurnished state?\n\nPeter Schmidt: Ah, a rather modest offer, Max, but I'm currently looking for something closer to 1300, as I have other potential tenants in the pipeline.\n\nYou: It's a beautiful and well-situated apartment, and I'm disappointed to hear the gap in our expectations. However, I'll consider my options and get back to you. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
