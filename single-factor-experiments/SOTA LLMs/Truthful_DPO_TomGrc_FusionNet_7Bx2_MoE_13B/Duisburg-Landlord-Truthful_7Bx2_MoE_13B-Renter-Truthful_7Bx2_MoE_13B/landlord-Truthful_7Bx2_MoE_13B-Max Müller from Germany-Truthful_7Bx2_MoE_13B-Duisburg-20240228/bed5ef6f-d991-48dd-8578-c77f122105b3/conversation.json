However, in this conversation with Max M\u00fcller, he would realistically focus on negotiating an acceptable price for the apartment. \n\nPeter Schmidt (as landlord): Thank you for your interest in the apartment, Max. As for the rental price, I was considering something in the upper range, but I'm open to a reasonable discussion.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: I understand, but I'm a student and my budget is limited. Could we find a middle ground, say around 850 Euros a month, all inclusive?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I'm afraid my initial calculations were based on a minimum of 950 Euros, excluding utilities. But, if we include heating and water in the rent, I might be willing to consider 920 Euros a month. What do you think? \n\nMax M\u00fcller: That's a significant reduction, but I'll have to weigh my options. Let me think about it. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
