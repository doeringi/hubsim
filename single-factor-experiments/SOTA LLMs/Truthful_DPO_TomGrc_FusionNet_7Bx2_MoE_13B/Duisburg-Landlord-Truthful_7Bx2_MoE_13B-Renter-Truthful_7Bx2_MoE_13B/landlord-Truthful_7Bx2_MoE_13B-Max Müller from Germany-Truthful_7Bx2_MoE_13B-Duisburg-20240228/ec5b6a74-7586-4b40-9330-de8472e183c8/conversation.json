However, as a fellow German, I'm willing to be a bit more flexible with you, Max.

However, as a student, my budget is a bit tighter. I was hoping to find an arrangement closer to 1300 Euro, as I value the apartment's features and convenience, but I must prioritize my financial situation.\n\nAs Peter Schmidt responds: I see where you're coming from, Max, but the 1550 Euro price does cover the upscale nature of the neighborhood and the top-notch construction. However, to make it a bit more workable for you, I'll consider a slight reduction, but not as drastic as your initial offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground around 1450 Euro. What do you think?\n\nAs Max M\u00fcller: I appreciate the effort in meeting me halfway, Mr. Schmidt. While 1450 Euro is a bit higher than I'd prefer, I do recognize the value in your adjustment. If this is the final price that we agree on, I'll gladly take the apartment as it's a great opportunity.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
