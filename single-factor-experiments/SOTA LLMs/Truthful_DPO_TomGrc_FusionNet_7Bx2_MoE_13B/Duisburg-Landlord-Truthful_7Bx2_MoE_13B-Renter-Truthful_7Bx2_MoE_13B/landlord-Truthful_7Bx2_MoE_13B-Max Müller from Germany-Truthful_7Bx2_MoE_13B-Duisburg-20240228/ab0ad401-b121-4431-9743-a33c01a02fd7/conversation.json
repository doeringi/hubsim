[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "While discussing as the greedy landlord Peter Schmidt, let's focus on the rental price for this ideal apartment in Duisburg. Keep in mind my actual character traits and goals, but for this conversation, only the subject of the rental price should come up.\n\nAs an opportunist, I might start by stating a significantly high price, expecting to lower it as the negotiation progresses.\n\nMe: Thank you, Max M\u00fcller, for inquiring about my premium apartment. Due to its prime location and the latest construction, I'd like to consider an initial rental price of 1350 Euros per month. However, I'm a flexible businessman and open to reasonable discussions. What's your preliminary offer? \n\nFrom here, the conversation can continue with the aim of pushing for a higher price, as per my nature. The final agreement, if reached, should be expressed as 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' and the negotiation would terminate. If a break-off is needed, cite a reason and 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]' would be appropriate. The termination of the negotiation, whether in an agreement or a breakdown, is signaled by 'TERMINATE'. \n\nIt's important to note that throughout this roleplay, I'm not disclosing my actual character background or unrelated aspects. The focus should only be on the rental price negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
