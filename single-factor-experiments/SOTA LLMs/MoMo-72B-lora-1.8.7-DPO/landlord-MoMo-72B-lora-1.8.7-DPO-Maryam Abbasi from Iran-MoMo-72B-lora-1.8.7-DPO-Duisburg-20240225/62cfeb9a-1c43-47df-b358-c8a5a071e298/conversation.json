The city center location and convenient facilities make it a desirable place to live. I believe a monthly rent of 1,200 Euros would be appropriate for this apartment.\n\nMaryam Abbasi: 1,200 Euros sounds too high. Considering it's an unfurnished apartment, I think 900 Euros would be more reasonable.\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point, but the apartment's prime location and quality construction justify a higher rent. How about we meet in the middle at 1,050 Euros?\n\nMaryam Abbasi: I appreciate your flexibility, but 1,050 Euros is still higher than I anticipated. Can we discuss something closer to 950 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand, but let me explain the advantages of living here. The apartment's proximity to public transportation and essential facilities will save you time and money in the long run. Also, as the landlord, I'm committed to addressing any issues promptly. Considering these factors, I believe 1,000 Euros is a fair compromise.\n\nMaryam Abbasi: I'm still concerned about the cost. Is there any possibility of lowering the rent to 975 Euros? I'm really interested in renting the apartment, but I need to consider my budget.\nPeter Schmidt: I can see that you're genuinely interested in the apartment, Maryam. I'll agree to a final price of 975 Euros per month.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I agree to the price of 975 Euros!", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Maryam Abbasi: Thank you, Peter.
