I'm glad you like the place. The apartment is in high demand due to its prime location and modern design. I was thinking of a rental price of 1,200 Euros per month.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: That's quite expensive, Mr. Schmidt. What about 900 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: 900 Euros, you say? Well, considering the apartment's size, facilities, and proximity to essential services, I believe it's a fair deal at 1,200 Euros. However, I am open to negotiation. How about meeting halfway at 1,050 Euros?\n\nFarhad Abbasi: Hmm, I understand the apartment's value, but it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at 1,000 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: 1,000 Euros, huh? Let me think about it. I appreciate your interest, but I believe the apartment is worth more. I'll agree to 1,025 Euros as a compromise, taking into account your budget constraints and the apartment's value.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: Alright, Mr. Schmidt. I agree to the price of 1,025 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: Great! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
