The apartment is in a prime location, offering convenience and comfort. I believe my asking price of 1,200 Euros per month is reasonable.\nYi-Nuo Wang: I understand that, but I think it's a bit high for a one-bedroom apartment. How about 1,000 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Ms. Wang, but 1,200 Euros is the minimum I can accept. The apartment is newly built and in a sought-after area.\nYi-Nuo Wang: Alright, then how about 1,100 Euros per month? It's a fair compromise.\nPeter Schmidt: Hmm, I see your point. However, if you agree to a 12-month lease with automatic renewal, I could consider 1,150 Euros per month.\nYi-Nuo Wang: That's still slightly higher than I had in mind, but I understand your perspective. How about 1,125 Euros per month, and I'll commit to a 12-month lease?\nPeter Schmidt: I agree to the price of 1,125 Euros per month. Let's proceed with the paperwork for the 12-month lease.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
