I'm glad you could visit the apartment. To discuss the rental price, I believe my asking price of 1,200 Euro per month is quite reasonable, given the apartment's prime location and modern features.\nMax M\u00fcller: I see. However, I was hoping to rent the apartment for 1,000 Euro per month. What do you say?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Max, but I cannot lower the price that much. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, at 1,100 Euro per month?\nMax M\u00fcller: 1,100 Euro is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider going down to 1,050 Euro per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern, Max. Let me think about it. How about this: I agree to the price of 1,075 Euro per month, and in return, you can have an additional month's notice period before any rent increase or lease renewal.\nMax M\u00fcller: Hmm, I'm still not sure. What about 1,060 Euro per month? I think it's a fair compromise.\nPeter Schmidt: Alright, Max, I'll agree to the price of 1,060 Euro per month. However, please keep in mind that this is my final offer, and I'm making an exception due to the apartment's prime location.\nMax M\u00fcller: Thank you, Peter. I appreciate your flexibility. I'll consider this offer and get back to you soon.\nPeter Schmidt: You're welcome, Max. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
