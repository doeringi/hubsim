The apartment is in a prime location, and I'm sure you'll find it very appealing. I'm open to discussing the rental price. What is your budget in mind?\nMax M\u00fcller: I was thinking around 700 Euros per month.\nMister Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Max, but for an apartment of this quality and prime location, I'd prefer a higher price. How about we start at 800 Euros per month?\nMax M\u00fcller: 800 Euros seems a bit high, but I understand the location's value. Would you consider lowering it to 750 Euros?\nMister Schmidt: 750 Euros is still lower than what I'd ideally like, but I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. How about we meet halfway and agree on 775 Euros per month?\nMax M\u00fcller: 775 Euros is still beyond my budget, but I really like the apartment. Is there any chance you could lower it even further?\nMister Schmidt: I understand, Max. As a gesture of goodwill, I could lower it to 765 Euros per month. I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us.\nMax M\u00fcller: That's more within my budget. Thank you for considering my situation, Mister Schmidt. I'll take the apartment at 765 Euros per month.\nMister Schmidt: Great, Max! I agree to the price of 765 Euros per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: Thank you so much. I look forward to moving in.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
