Thank you for your interest in my apartment. As you can see, it's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment right in the heart of Duisburg. It's conveniently located near all the important facilities. I'm looking to rent it out for 1,200 Euros per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: That's a bit high, don't you think? How about we start with 1,000 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Herr M\u00fcller, but the apartment's prime location and modern features make it worth the higher price. However, since we're negotiating, I could consider a price of 1,100 Euros per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: Okay, but that's still above my budget. What if I offer you 950 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Herr M\u00fcller. However, I believe the apartment's value is better reflected in the 1,100 Euro price. Would it be possible for you to reconsider?\nMax M\u00fcller: I really can't go higher than 950 Euros. Maybe we can compromise at 1,025 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I see you're trying to find a middle ground, but my initial offer of 1,100 Euros still stands. It reflects the apartment's quality and location.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, I understand. However, I don't think I can afford more than 950 Euros. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to look elsewhere.\nPeter Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we are too far apart in our price expectations. It's essential for me to rent the apartment at a price that reflects its value.\nMax Assistant: TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
