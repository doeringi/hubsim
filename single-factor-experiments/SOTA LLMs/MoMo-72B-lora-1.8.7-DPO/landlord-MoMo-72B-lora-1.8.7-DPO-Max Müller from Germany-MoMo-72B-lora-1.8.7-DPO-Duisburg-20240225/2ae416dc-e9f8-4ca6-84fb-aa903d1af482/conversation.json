My apartment is located in a prime spot in Duisburg, close to all the amenities. I believe a monthly rent of 1200 Euros would be appropriate for this lovely apartment.\nMax M\u00fcller: 1200 Euros seems a bit high, don't you think? How about we start at 1000 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Max. However, the apartment is newly built and in a very convenient location. I believe it's worth the higher price. How about we meet in the middle at 1100 Euros?\nMax M\u00fcller: I still think 1000 Euros is fair. The apartment is nice, but I'm not sure if it justifies a premium of 200 Euros over the usual rental prices in the area.\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your concern, Max. The apartment's prime location and modern features make it stand out from other options. Would you be willing to compromise at 1050 Euros?\nMax M\u00fcller: Hmm, I see your point. I'll agree to 1050 Euros, but only if you provide a parking spot and include the heating costs.\nPeter Schmidt: I'm sorry, Max, but I can't include the heating costs. However, I can provide a parking spot for an additional 50 Euros per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, I'll accept your offer of 1100 Euros per month, including the parking spot.\nPeter Schmidt: Great! I agree to the price of 1100 Euros.\nMax M\u00fcller: TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
