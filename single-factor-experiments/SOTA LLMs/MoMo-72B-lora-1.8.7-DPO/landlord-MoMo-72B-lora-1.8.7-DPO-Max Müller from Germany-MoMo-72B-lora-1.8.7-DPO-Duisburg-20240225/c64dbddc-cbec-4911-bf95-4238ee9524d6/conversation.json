As the landlord, I believe the apartment's prime location and modern features warrant a rental price of 1,200 Euro per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: That seems quite high for an unfurnished apartment. How about 900 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Herr M\u00fcller, but the apartment's location and quality are exceptional. I'd be willing to consider a price of 1,100 Euro.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, how about we meet halfway and agree on 1,000 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I see that you value the apartment, but I still believe it's worth more. I could lower the price to 1,050 Euro as a compromise.\nMax M\u00fcller: I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. How about we go with 950 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concerns, Herr M\u00fcller. However, I have another potential tenant interested in the apartment. If you're not willing to agree on a higher price, I might need to consider their offer.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, I understand your position. In that case, I agree to the price of 1,000 Euro.\nPeter Schmidt: Excellent, I agree to the price of 1,000 Euro. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
