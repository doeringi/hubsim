I was hoping to rent it for 400 Euros per month. Considering the apartment's unfurnished state, I think it's a reasonable offer.\nHuman: Guten Tag, Herr Wang. I understand your situation, but the apartment's prime location and modern features make it more valuable. I cannot go below 550 Euros per month for the rent.\n(Hold for Haoyu's response)\nAssistant: Danke, Herr Schmidt. I understand your perspective, but I would like to negotiate further. What if I agree to a 12-month lease without any additional requests, such as maintenance or repair costs? Would you be willing to lower the rent to 450 Euros per month in that case?\nHuman: Guten Tag, Herr Wang. I appreciate your offer, but I cannot go lower than 500 Euros per month. The apartment's location and quality are worth more than my initial offer.\n(Hold for Haoyu's response)\nAssistant: Danke, Herr Schmidt. I understand your standpoint. However, I still think that 450 Euros would be a fair compromise. Can we meet somewhere in between, like 475 Euros per month?\nHuman: Guten Tag, Herr Wang. I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground. In that case, I can lower the rent to 480 Euros per month, which is my final offer.\n(Hold for Haoyu's response)\nAssistant: Danke, Herr Schmidt. I understand that you've made an effort to accommodate my request. I agree to the price of 480 Euros per month. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
