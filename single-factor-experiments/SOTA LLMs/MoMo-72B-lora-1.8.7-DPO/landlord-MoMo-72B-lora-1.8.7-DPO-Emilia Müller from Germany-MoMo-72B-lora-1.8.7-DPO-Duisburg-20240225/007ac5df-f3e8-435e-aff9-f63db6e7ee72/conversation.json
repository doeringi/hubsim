The apartment is in a prime location, close to all necessary facilities. I'm open to discussing the rental price. What's your initial thought on the monthly cost?\nEmilia M\u00fcller: After looking around the apartment, I think it would be fair to pay 700 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Emilia, but I was considering a higher rent due to the apartment's location and size. How about we increase it to 800 Euros?\nEmilia M\u00fcller: 800 Euros is quite steep for a single person like me. Can we negotiate and settle on 750 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, but this is a newly built apartment in the city center. I believe 800 Euros would be more fitting. However, I'm open to including an extra week's notice period before terminating the lease.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: That's a good point, but I still think 750 Euros would be fair. How about I agree to a two-year lease instead of a one-year lease?\nPeter Schmidt: I see that you're trying to negotiate, but the apartment's worth more than that. What if we compromise at 775 Euros per month, and you agree to a two-year lease?\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Alright, I'll agree to 775 Euros per month for a two-year lease.\nPeter Schmidt: Great! I agree to the price of 775 Euros.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Thank you, Peter. I look forward to moving in.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
