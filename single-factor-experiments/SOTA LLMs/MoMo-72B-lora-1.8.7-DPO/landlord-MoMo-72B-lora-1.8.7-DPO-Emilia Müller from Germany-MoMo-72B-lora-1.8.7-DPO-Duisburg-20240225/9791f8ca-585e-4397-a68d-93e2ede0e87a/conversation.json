The apartment is a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom in the city center. It's conveniently located near all important facilities. I'm open to discussing the rental price.\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: How much are you asking for rent?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I'm considering a monthly rent of 950 Euros for this apartment. It's a fair price, given its location and size.\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: That seems a bit high. How about 850 Euros?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, but the apartment is in high demand due to its prime location. Would you be willing to discuss any additional lease conditions that might make it more attractive?\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: I understand, but I think 875 Euros would be a reasonable compromise.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point, but I'm willing to lower the price slightly to 925 Euros. It's a competitive offer, considering all the apartment's benefits.\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Alright, I'll consider that. However, I still think 875 Euros is more appropriate.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, but I can't go any lower than 900 Euros. It's a fair price that reflects the apartment's value and location.\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Hmm, I appreciate your time, but I'm not sure if I can commit to 900 Euros per month.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe the apartment's value is worth the asking price.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
