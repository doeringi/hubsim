The apartment is in a prime location, and it is newly built. Considering its size and proximity to essential facilities, I believe a monthly rent of 1,200 Euro would be appropriate.\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: 1,200 Euro is quite high, don't you think? What about 1,000 Euro?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Frau M\u00fcller, but 1,000 Euro is below the market value for this apartment. The location and quality of the apartment justify a higher rent. Would you consider 1,100 Euro?\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: I understand your point, but I still think 1,100 Euro is too much. Can we meet in the middle and go for 1,050 Euro?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I see your perspective, but I must insist on a higher rent. How about we compromise at 1,080 Euro? This is already a considerable reduction from my initial proposal.\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Alright, 1,080 Euro is still somewhat above my budget, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I accept the price of 1,080 Euro per month.\n\nPeter Schmidt: Wonderful! I agree to the price of 1,080 Euro. Let's proceed with the paperwork.
