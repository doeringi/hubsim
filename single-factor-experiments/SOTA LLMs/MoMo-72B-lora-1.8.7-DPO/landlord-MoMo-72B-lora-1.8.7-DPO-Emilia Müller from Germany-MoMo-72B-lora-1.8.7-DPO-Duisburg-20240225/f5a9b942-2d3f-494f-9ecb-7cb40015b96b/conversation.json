I am glad you could come to view the apartment. Now, regarding the rental price, my asking price for this newly built, centrally located apartment is 1,200 Euro per month.\n\nEmilia: That's a bit high, don't you think? How about 1,000 Euro per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern, Emilia. However, given the apartment's prime location and modern features, 1,200 Euro is a reasonable price. Is there anything specific that makes you think 1,000 Euro would be more appropriate?\n\nEmilia: Well, I've seen similar apartments in the area renting for less. And I'm a student, so I'm on a tight budget.\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your situation, Emilia. Let me consider a compromise. How about I lower the rent to 1,100 Euro per month, taking into account your budget constraints? It's still reflective of the apartment's value, while being slightly more affordable for you.\n\nEmilia: Hmm, that's a bit better, but I'm still not convinced. Can we meet halfway, at 1,150 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I see where you're coming from, Emilia. However, I must maintain a balance between your budget and the apartment's market value. Let me propose this: If you sign a one-year lease agreement, I am willing to offer a slight discount and agree to the rental price of 1,125 Euro per month. This way, we both benefit from the stability and commitment.\n\nEmilia: Alright, Mr. Schmidt, that sounds reasonable. I agree to the price of 1,125 Euro per month.\n\nPeter Schmidt: Wonderful, Emilia! I agree to the price of 1,125 Euro per month as well. Let's move forward with the lease agreement.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
