Because I am on a tight budget, I am hoping to pay 500 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's quite low for the location and the standard of the apartment. I'm looking for a fair market price, which would be closer to 800 euros per month. What do you think about that?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your response. However, 800 euros is quite high for me.

What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your understanding. I agree to the price of 675 euros per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 675 euros per month! That's great news, Max.
