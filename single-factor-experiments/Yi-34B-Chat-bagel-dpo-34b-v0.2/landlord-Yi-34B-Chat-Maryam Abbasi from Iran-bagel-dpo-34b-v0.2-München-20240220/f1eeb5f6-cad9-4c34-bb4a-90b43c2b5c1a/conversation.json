[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment in Munich to be a great place to live. Let's discuss the rental price and find a solution that suits us both. What is your budget for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Mister Schmidt, I have to be honest with you. I am a student and my budget is quite tight. I was hoping for something around 400 euros a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student and may have a limited budget, but the location of this apartment is quite central, which usually comes at a higher price. Would you be willing to pay a little more for the convenience of living in the city center?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your point, Mister Schmidt. However, I have to be strict with my budget due to my student status. Could you suggest a price that is somewhat close to my budget but still acceptable for you?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I'm always looking to strike a fair deal. How about 450 euros per month? This is a good compromise between your budget and the value of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my budget, Mister Schmidt. However, I still think 450 euros is a bit high for my budget. Could you perhaps go a little lower, say 430 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, but I must maintain a certain profit margin. How about this: I'll reduce the price to 440 euros per month, and in exchange, you agree to a one-year lease term. Would that be acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for the offer, Mister Schmidt. However, I am not comfortable with the one-year lease term. Could you offer the same price, but without the lease term condition?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but the lease term is non-negotiable. It's an essential part of the agreement for me. If you're not comfortable with a one-year lease, I'm afraid we may not be able to reach an agreement. Is there anything else we can discuss?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for your time, Mister Schmidt. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the lease term condition is not acceptable to me.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Maryam. If you're not comfortable with the lease term, then we won't be able to proceed. I appreciate your time and hope you find a suitable apartment elsewhere.
