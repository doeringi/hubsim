I am sure you will find my apartment quite attractive. Let's discuss the price.

While 600 euros is a fair offer, I must admit that I am looking for a slightly higher amount to ensure I cover my expenses and make a reasonable profit. Would you be willing to go a bit higher?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "How about 650 euros? It's a nice round number and I believe it's a fair price for a newly built apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "650 euros is a step in the right direction, Emilia, but I still believe the apartment's location and quality justify a higher price.

It's a nice round number and it's very close to your initial offer. I believe it's a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, you are a tough negotiator. 688 euros is indeed a fair price, and I must admit, it's getting closer to what I'm looking for.

This would be my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 700 euros!
