[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Emilia, it's my pleasure to show you the apartment. I'm sure you'll find it quite appealing with its central location and modern amenities. Let's get straight to the point regarding the rental price. How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, since the apartment is unfurnished and newly built, I think a reasonable price would be around 500 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 euros is far below my expectations. This apartment is in the city center and offers a high standard of living. I'm looking for a rent closer to 800 euros per month. What do you think about that?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, but considering the unfurnished state of the apartment and the average prices in Duisburg, I think a more reasonable price would be 600 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, 600 euros is still not acceptable to me. The location and the quality of the apartment justify a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate, but only if you're willing to meet me halfway.

However, I still believe that 700 euros would be a fair deal for both parties. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 675 euros per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 675 euros is still not enough for me to accept. The apartment is in high demand, and I'm certain I can find a tenant who is willing to pay 700 euros. If you're not willing to meet that price, I'd rather continue searching for a tenant who values the location and quality of this apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is not acceptable to me.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your decision, Emilia. If you change your mind or are willing to consider a higher price, please let me know.
