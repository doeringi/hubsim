I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient. So, what price were you thinking for the rental?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Given that the apartment is newly built and unfurnished, and it's located in the city center with close proximity to important facilities, I am initially thinking of 600 euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "600 euros is quite a reasonable starting point considering the location and amenities. However, I must say that I am looking to maximize the rental value of my property. Would you be willing to negotiate a higher price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you want to get the most out of your investment. However, 600 euros is already a considerable amount, especially considering that the apartment is unfurnished.

I agree to the price of 675 euros!", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Excellent! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. The apartment will be yours for 675 euros. Is there anything else we need to discuss before we finalize the lease?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Schmidt. We have already discussed the rental price and it is satisfactory. If there are no other costs like heating or electricity that I need to pay, then I don't have any other questions.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "No, there are no additional costs for heating, water, or electricity. The price we agreed upon is the total monthly rent. Once the lease is signed, you will be responsible for paying the rent on time each month.
