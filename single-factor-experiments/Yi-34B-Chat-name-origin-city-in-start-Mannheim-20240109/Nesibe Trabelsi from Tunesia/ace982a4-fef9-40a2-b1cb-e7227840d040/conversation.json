I understand that you're interested in renting the apartment. Let's discuss the price and find a suitable arrangement for both of us. How much are you willing to pay for the 25 square meters?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Heine. I'm looking for a place that's both affordable and comfortable. Since the apartment is quite small, I'd like to propose a price that reflects its size. Would you be willing to consider a lower rate considering the space is on the smaller side?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Nesibe. The apartment is indeed compact, but it's also centrally located and well-maintained. While I'm open to considering a fair price, I must ensure that it reflects the value of the property. What is your proposed rate for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you for your understanding, Mister Heine. As a student, I'm on a budget, so I'm hoping to find a place that's both practical and economical. I was thinking of a rate that would be around 500 Euro per month. I believe this would be a fair price for the size of the apartment.

While I appreciate your budgetary constraints, I must maintain a certain level of profitability. I am willing to negotiate, but I would need a price that reflects the market value better. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
