The apartment is indeed very appealing, and I'm interested in renting it. As a student, I'm looking for a fair price that fits within my budget. I'd like to propose a price of 650 Euros per month, including all utilities. Would that be acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, 650 Euros per month is a very generous offer, but considering the size and location of the apartment, I believe we can find a price that reflects its true value. How about we start with a price slightly higher, say, 750 Euros per month? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the amenities the apartment offers. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Herr Heine, your counter-offer is appreciated. While 750 Euros per month is higher than my initial offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about 700 Euros per month, including all utilities? This would be a fair compromise, in my opinion.
