Please, feel free to ask any questions you have about the apartment. Regarding the rental price, I'm sure we can find a fair agreement that suits both our needs.

What are your thoughts on this?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, \u20ac800 is a bit higher than I had anticipated. Given that the apartment is on the smaller side at 25 square meters, I believe \u20ac750 would be more in line with the market value for this area.

While \u20ac750 may be closer to what you were expecting, I must insist on \u20ac800 due to the unique features and the prime location of the apartment. However, I'm willing to negotiate. How about this: if you can convince me that \u20ac775 is the best I can get for this apartment, I'll agree to that price. How would you sell the \u20ac775 to me?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
