While I appreciate your willingness to pay that amount, I must be honest with you. The asking price for this apartment is 650 Euros per month. However, if you are a long-term tenant and are willing to pay 6 months' rent in advance, we can discuss a discount. Would you be interested in such an arrangement?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, I appreciate your honesty. While the upfront cost of 6 months' rent might be a bit steep for me, I'm interested in the apartment and would like to negotiate a price that works for both of us. Is there any possibility of a lower price if I sign a one-year lease?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, a one-year lease is an attractive offer for a landlord.
