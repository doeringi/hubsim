[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Mannheim.

I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. Let's discuss the price and make it work for both of us.

I'm really looking to keep my expenses down as a student. Could we perhaps meet in the middle? Maybe 650 Euros? This would still be very fair for the apartment, and it would be more manageable for me financially. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, as a student, I understand that every euro counts. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference? We'll settle at 675 Euros. This is a good compromise and still within your budget, I hope. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
