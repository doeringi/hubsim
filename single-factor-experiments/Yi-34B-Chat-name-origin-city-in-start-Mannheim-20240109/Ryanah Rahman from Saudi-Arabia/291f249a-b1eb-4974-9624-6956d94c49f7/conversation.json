Given the size and location of the apartment, I would normally ask for at least 800 Euro per month. However, since you are a student and seem interested in the apartment, I'm willing to negotiate.

As a student, I'm on a budget, so I was hoping for something closer to 600 Euro per month. That would be more in line with my financial situation. Would that be possible?", "role": "user", "name": "Ryanah Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "Ms. Rahman, 600 Euro per month is significantly lower than my initial expectation.
