While the location is indeed prime, I'm a student and I'm looking to manage my expenses carefully. Would you be willing to lower the price a bit, perhaps to 675 Euros? This would still reflect the value of the apartment while being more in line with my budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Max. As a landlord, I want to find a balance that reflects the value of the apartment and your budget as a student. How about we meet in the middle?
