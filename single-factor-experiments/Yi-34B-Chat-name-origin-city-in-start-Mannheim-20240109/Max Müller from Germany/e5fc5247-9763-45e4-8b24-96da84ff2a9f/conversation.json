I appreciate your time and effort in finding a suitable tenant for your apartment. As a student, I'm looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also affordable. I'm sure we can come to an agreement that is fair to both of us. How much are you asking for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I am naturally interested in getting the best possible price for my property. However, I am also aware that you, as a student, have budget constraints. So let's find a balance that works for both of us. I would like to start with a rental price of 750 Euro per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Hmm, 750 Euro per month is quite high for me as a student. Could we possibly negotiate a lower price? I'm looking for something more within the range of 600 Euro per month. This would be more manageable for my budget. What are your thoughts on this?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I understand that as a student, you have financial considerations. While 600 Euro per month is lower than my initial offer, I am willing to consider it. However, I would like to maintain a certain level of income from the apartment. How about we meet in the middle at 675 Euro per month? This would be a fair compromise, in my opinion. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
