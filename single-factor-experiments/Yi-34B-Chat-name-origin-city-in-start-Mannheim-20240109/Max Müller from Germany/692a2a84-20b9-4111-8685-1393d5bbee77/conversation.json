However, I must confess that I am looking for a price that reflects the current market value of the apartment. It's a desirable location, and I believe the apartment is quite spacious for the area. I'm open to counteroffers, but I would like to start at a higher price. How does 1,000 Euro per month sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Herr Heine, your counteroffer of 1,000 Euro per month is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I appreciate the quality of the apartment and the location, but my budget is quite limited as a student. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to my initial offer, perhaps around 850 Euro per month? I believe this would be a fair compromise considering the market value and my financial situation.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, as a landlord, I understand your budget constraints.
