I appreciate your time and the opportunity to lease this apartment. I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also fits within my budget. I'm a student, so affordability is key for me. How much are you asking for this 25 square meter space?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I understand that finding the right balance between price and affordability is important. I initially had a figure in mind, but I'm open to considering your budget as a student. What is the maximum amount you can afford to pay per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "As a student, I'm looking to keep my expenses as low as possible while still getting a decent place to live. I'd say the maximum I can afford to pay per month is around 600 Euros, including all utilities. Is there any way we can work with that amount?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "600 Euros per month is a reasonable budget for a student, but considering the location and the size of the apartment, I was initially thinking of a higher price. However, since you're a student and you've mentioned utilities, let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. How does 650 Euros per month sound to you, including all utilities? This would be a fair rate, considering the market value for similar apartments in the area.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
