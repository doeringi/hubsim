I'm looking for a price that reflects the size of the apartment and the location.

The apartment is indeed on the smaller side, which is why I'm open to discussing a price that is fair for both parties. I was initially thinking of a monthly rent of \u20ac750.

Would you like to make a counter-proposal?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "\u20ac750 is a bit higher than what I had in mind for the size of the apartment.
