I'm looking for a place that's affordable and comfortable. Since the apartment is 25 square meters, I was hoping we could find a price that reflects its size and amenities.

I appreciate that you're open to negotiation. While \u20ac750 is a fair starting point, I would like to discuss if there's any room for further reduction.

Could we perhaps discuss a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Bo Li from China"}, {"content": "As a student, I'm sure you're looking to save where you can. How about we aim for a middle ground?
