I understand that you're looking for a balance between affordability and comfort. I'm aiming to find a tenant who will appreciate the apartment's qualities and be a good long-term resident.

What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Your offer of 800 Euro per month, excluding utilities, is a good starting point. However, I'm looking to negotiate the best deal possible. Could we discuss the possibility of a lower price? I believe that a fair price would be closer to 750 Euro per month, considering the size of the apartment and the fact that it's 25 square meters. What are your thoughts on this?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Aziz, your counter-offer of 750 Euro per month is an interesting point to discuss. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must consider the current market rates and the value I place on the apartment. It's a prime location with excellent amenities nearby, which justifies a higher price point. Nevertheless, I'm willing to listen to your arguments and find a price that satisfies both of us. Would you like to proceed with further negotiations?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
