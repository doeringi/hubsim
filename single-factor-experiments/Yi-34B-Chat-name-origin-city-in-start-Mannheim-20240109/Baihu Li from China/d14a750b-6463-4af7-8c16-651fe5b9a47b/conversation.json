I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also affordable. I'm a student, so I'm on a tight budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that suits both our needs.

How does 750 euros per month sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Mr. Heine. 750 euros per month is a bit higher than my budget as a student. I was hoping for something closer to 500 euros per month, considering the size of the apartment and my financial situation. Would you be willing to lower the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "500 euros per month is significantly lower than my initial offer.
