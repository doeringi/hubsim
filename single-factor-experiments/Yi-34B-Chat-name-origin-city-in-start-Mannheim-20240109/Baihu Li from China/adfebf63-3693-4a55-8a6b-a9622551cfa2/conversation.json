As we both know, the real estate market in Mannheim can be quite competitive. I'm sure you're looking for a fair price, and I'm here to ensure I get the best deal for my property. Let's negotiate a price that reflects the value of the apartment and meets both our needs.

I appreciate your time and effort in finding a suitable tenant for this apartment. As a student, I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also within my budget. The apartment seems to fit my needs perfectly, and I'm willing to pay a fair price for it. I understand that the market is competitive, and I'm ready to negotiate a price that's reasonable for both parties.

As a landlord, I want to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for my property, while also taking into consideration your budget as a student.

As a student, I have a budget of around 650 Euro per month for rent. I understand that this is lower than the market value, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. The apartment is quite small, at 25 square meters, which aligns well with my needs as a student. I'm looking for a long-term arrangement and am willing to commit to a two-year lease, if that helps in our negotiations.", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "Thank you for being open about your budget, Mr. Li. A two-year lease is indeed a long-term commitment, and it's something I appreciate from a tenant. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. How about this: If you agree to the two-year lease and are willing to make a small contribution to the utilities, I could consider a price of 700 Euro per month. This is still within your budget and reflects the market value to some extent. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
