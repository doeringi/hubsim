I'm sure you'll find the apartment quite comfortable. Let's discuss the price. What is your budget for rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Heine. I'm looking to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible, considering it's a student budget. I'm very dependable and responsible, and I'd like to maintain a good relationship with my landlord. The apartment is quite spacious at 25 square meters, which is perfect for my needs. How much are you asking for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Hassan Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student and looking to keep costs low. The apartment is indeed a good size for one person. I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. Let's say, to start with, I'm asking for 600 Euro per month. What do you think about this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "600 Euro per month is quite a bit higher than what I was hoping for. I'm looking to spend around 450 Euro per month, which I believe is a more student-friendly price. Is there any room to negotiate on this?", "role": "user", "name": "Hassan Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "450 Euro per month is significantly lower than my initial offer. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I must consider my own financial goals. However, I'm willing to work with you to find a price that is acceptable to both parties. How about we meet in the middle at 525 Euro per month? This would be a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
