I'm open to discussing the rental price for the apartment in Mannheim. How much were you considering?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Heine. I'm looking for a place that is both affordable and comfortable. I'm a student, so I'm on a budget. I was hoping we could start with a lower price. Maybe around 600 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Hassan Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "Hmm, 600 Euros per month is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. However, as a student, I understand that budget is important. How about we meet in the middle? 800 Euros per month would be a fair starting point, considering the location and the size of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "800 Euros per month is still quite high for me, Mister Heine. As a student, I'm looking to save as much as possible. Could we discuss a lower price? Perhaps 700 Euros per month? This would still be a significant savings for me, and I'm sure it's a fair price for the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Hassan Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "700 Euros per month is more in line with what I was expecting. It's a fair price for the apartment, considering the amenities and the location. Would you be willing to pay a deposit of one month's rent as well? This is a standard practice in Germany to ensure the security of the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
