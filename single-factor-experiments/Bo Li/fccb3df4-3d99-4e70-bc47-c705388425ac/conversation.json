While \u20ac500-\u20ac600 per month may be a bit lower than our proposed rental price of \u20ac700, we are willing to negotiate and find a fair rental price that works for both parties. We do have other options available, but they are subject to availability and may not be as spacious as the 25 square meter apartment with a balcony.\n\nBased on our discussions, I propose that we meet in the middle and agree on a rental price of \u20ac600 per month.
