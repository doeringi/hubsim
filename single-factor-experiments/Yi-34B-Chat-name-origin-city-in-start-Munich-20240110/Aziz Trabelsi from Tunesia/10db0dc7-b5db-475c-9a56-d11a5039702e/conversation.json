I'm looking for a reasonable and fair price that reflects the size and location of the apartment. I'm hoping we can agree on a price that is beneficial for both parties. Could you please make an initial offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Certainly, Aziz. Considering the size of the apartment and its location, I would suggest a starting price of 1,200 Euros per month.

What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Mister Heine. While 1,200 Euros is a fair price, I was hoping we could discuss a slightly lower amount. The apartment is a bit smaller than I was initially looking for, so I would appreciate if we could negotiate a price that reflects this. How about 1,100 Euros? This would still be a fair price for the landlord and a good deal for me as a tenant. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Aziz, your counteroffer of 1,100 Euros is quite reasonable, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I must remind you that the market value for this apartment is indeed around 1,200 Euros. Nevertheless, I'm open to negotiating. How does 1,150 Euros sound to you? This would be a good compromise between your offer and my initial suggestion. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
