What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, 550 Euro per month is a bit more than I was expecting to pay. I'm a student and I'm looking to save as much as possible while still having a nice place to live. Could we possibly negotiate a lower price? Perhaps around 525 Euro per month? This would still be a fair price for the apartment, in my opinion.", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Nesibe, I understand that you're a student and want to save money.
