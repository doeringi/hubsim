I'm hoping for something closer to \u20ac750 per month, considering the size of the apartment and my student status. Would that be possible?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "\u20ac750 per month is certainly more in line with what students might be looking to spend.

This would be a good balance between your budget and the value of the apartment. Would you agree to this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
