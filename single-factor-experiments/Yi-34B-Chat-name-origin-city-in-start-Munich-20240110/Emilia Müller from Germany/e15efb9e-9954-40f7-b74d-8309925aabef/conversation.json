However, as a student, I'm looking for a place that fits within my budget while still providing a comfortable living space. Could we perhaps meet in the middle? I could offer 850 Euros per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Your offer of 850 Euros is more aligned with the value of the apartment, considering its location and condition.
