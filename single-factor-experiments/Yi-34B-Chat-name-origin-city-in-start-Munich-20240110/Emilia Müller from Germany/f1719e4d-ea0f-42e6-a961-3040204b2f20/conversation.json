What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, 650 Euros per month seems like a fair starting point. However, I'd like to get the best deal for both of us. How about we start with 700 Euros per month? This would reflect the current market value for apartments in this area. What is your final offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 700 Euros is a bit higher than what I had in mind. Could we meet in the middle, say at 675 Euros per month? This would be a fair compromise, I think.
