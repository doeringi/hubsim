I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also affordable. Considering the size of the apartment and the location, I think a fair price would be around 800 Euros per month. Is that something you would consider?", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "800 Euros per month is a reasonable offer, but given the current market conditions and the demand for apartments in Munich, I believe we can find a price that reflects the true value of the property. How about 900 Euros per month? This would be a fair reflection of the amenities and the location. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "900 Euros per month is a bit higher than what I had in mind, but I understand that the location and amenities are important. Since I'm a student and I'm looking for a long-term lease, could we negotiate a lower price? Perhaps 850 Euros per month? This would help me manage my expenses more effectively.", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I'm always open to negotiation. If you're willing to commit to a long-term lease, I might be able to consider your offer. However, I would like to have a 12-month contract with the option to extend.
