I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much are you willing to pay for it?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I am a student and I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also affordable. I'm smart, dependable, and responsible, and I always follow moral and ethical standards. I want to be on good terms with my landlord, so I'm hoping we can agree on a fair price for this newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, which is close to all important facilities. How much are you offering for it?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I appreciate your honesty and commitment to ethics. As a landlord, I understand the importance of finding a balance between a reasonable price for you and a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to start the negotiations at 750 Euros per month. Is this within your budget?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your starting offer is quite high for a student like me.

Would you be willing to consider this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, 600 Euros is significantly lower than my initial offer. I'm not sure I can go that low. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps around 700 Euros? This would still be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 700 Euros is still quite high for me as a student. I believe we can find a more equitable price. How about 650 Euros? This would be a fair compromise, in my opinion. Would you consider this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, 650 Euros is a step in the right direction, but it's still not quite where I'd like to be. I'm trying to strike a balance between your needs as a student and my financial goals. How about we meet at 675 Euros? This would be a more equitable price for both of us. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 675 Euros is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping for something a bit lower. I'm willing to pay 660 Euros per month for the apartment. This would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe. Would you be willing to accept this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, your persistence is impressive.
