[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. Let's discuss the rental price and find a fair agreement. How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm interested in your apartment, but I'm a student, so I'm looking for a good deal.

Is this within your budget?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "\u20ac800 is quite high for a student like me. Is there any possibility you could lower the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand that as a student, you may have budget constraints.

What is your decision?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "\u20ac700 is a bit closer to what I can afford, but I'm still finding it a bit steep. I'm sorry, but I can't go above \u20ac680. If you can accept that, I'd be very grateful.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your financial situation, but \u20ac680 is simply not enough for the apartment.
