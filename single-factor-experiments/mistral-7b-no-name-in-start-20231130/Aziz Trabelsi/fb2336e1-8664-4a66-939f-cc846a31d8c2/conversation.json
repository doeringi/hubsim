However, I'm afraid that \u20ac280 is still a bit too low for me to accept at this time. I would be willing to negotiate further, but I'm not sure that \u20ac280 is a price that would be sustainable for me to cover all of my expenses.\n\nMay I ask if there are any other factors that you're considering when determining the rental price, such as the size of the apartment, its location, or any amenities that it offers?\n\nI appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I hope we can come to a mutually agreeable rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Aziz Trabelsi"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, I understand that \u20ac280 may not be enough for you. However, I do think that it's a fair price based on the size and location of the apartment. May I suggest that we consider adding a security deposit, which you can keep as a form of compensation for any potential damage or unpaid rent. What do you think about that idea?\n\nAziz, I agree to the price of \u20ac280, but I would like to include a security deposit of \u20ac200.

I appreciate your willingness to work with me to find a mutually agreeable rental price.\n\nI am willing to consider a security deposit, but I would need to think about the specific terms and conditions before making a final decision. For example, I would need to know how long the security deposit would be held for, and how it would be returned to the tenant if there were no damages or unpaid rent.\n\nI will need to discuss this with my landlord and consider all of the factors involved in order to make a final decision.
