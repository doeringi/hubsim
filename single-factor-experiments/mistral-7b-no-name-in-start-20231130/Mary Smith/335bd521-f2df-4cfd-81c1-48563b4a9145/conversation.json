The apartment you are interested in is 25 square meters, and I would need to take into account various expenses such as maintenance and utilities, which would increase the overall cost. Additionally, I am a landlord and want to maximize my gains from renting out the apartment. Given these circumstances, I would need to charge more than 300 Euros per month. Would you be willing to consider a higher rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Yes, I can afford a little more. Please let me know what you need.", "role": "user", "name": "Mary Smith"}, {"content": "Thank you. In that case, I would require a rental price of 350 Euros per month.
