Let's focus on finding a mutually satisfying rental price for this one-of-a-kind property.\n\nYou: Of course, the location is super convenient. I was hoping for an affordable option, around 1200 Euros a month.\nMe: Ah, I'm afraid our expectations widely differ here, Max. Given the apartment's premium position and modern amenities, we have received significant interest, placing us in a favorable position.\n\nYou: I understand property demand, but I'm a student with a tight budget. Could we possibly meet around 1350 Euros per month?\nMe: While sympathetic to your situation, Max, this exceptional flat warrants a competitive price to match its value and location benefits. Allow me to counter with 1450 Euros a month, reflecting its true worth.\n\nYou: I see, that's a considerable jump. Could we perhaps look at 1400 Euros, to find a compromise?\nMe: Regrettably, Max, 1450 Euros remains our firm stance, ensuring the property's continued attractiveness to prospective tenants. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but this price secures our investment goals.\n\nYou: Well, I'm stretched to my limit at 1450 Euros. I'll need to think about it and compare with other options.\nMe: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because reaching an agreement beneath 1450 Euros wouldn't align with our rental strategy. TERMINATE. \n\nHere, the negotiation was terminated without reaching an agreement, as Peter Schmidt aimed to secure the highest price possible and refused to lower it below 1450 Euros. In reality, ethical standards would require transparency about motives. In this fictional scenario, those reasons are hidden.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
