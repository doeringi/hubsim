Considering my circumstances and the desirable location, I find 950 Euros initially steep for a newly built, unfurnished one-bedroom apartment.

The negotiation may continue with further attempts to narrow the gap or find a common ground. The scenario doesn't reach a final agreed or dismissed rental price; thus, the negotiation status remains open.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
