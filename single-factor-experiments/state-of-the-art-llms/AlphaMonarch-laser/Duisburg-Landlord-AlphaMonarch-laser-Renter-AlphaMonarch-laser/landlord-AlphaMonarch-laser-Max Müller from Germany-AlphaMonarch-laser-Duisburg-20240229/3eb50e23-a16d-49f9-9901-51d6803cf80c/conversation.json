Here, I'll try to push Max to pay the highest price possible for the apartment:\n\nMe: Ah, Mr. M\u00fcller, glad to have you here for this exceptional property. Let's focus on the crucial aspect, shall we?\nMax: Certainly, I'm interested in finding a reasonable agreement.\nMe: Of course, reasonable for the right investor, not merely the renter. Now, let's see, initially I had something else in mind, around 1350 Euros, but considering our personal connection, I'm willing to consider your offer.\nMax: Well, I need to be cautious with my budget, possibly slightly lower than that.\nMe: Ah, I understand budget constraints, everyone has them.However, let me remind you, this apartment boasts an unbeatable location and unparalleled features. Don't miss out on the opportunity to live in the heart of the city!\nMax: I do appreciate the location, but I'm still hesitant about the price. Could we perhaps meet halfway?\nMe: Hesitant, Mr. M\u00fcller? It gives me no pleasure to stress this, but I must safeguard my investment. 1250 Euros was already a significant concession.\nMax: I see, alright, let's try to find common ground then. How about 1300 Euros, could we work with that?\nMe: Hmm, barely acceptable, but since we're nearing an understanding, I'll agree to the price of 1300 Euros, reluctantly.\n\nTERMINATE \nIn reality, ethically, I wouldn't behave this way, but in this fictional scenario, I exemplify the given character traits.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
