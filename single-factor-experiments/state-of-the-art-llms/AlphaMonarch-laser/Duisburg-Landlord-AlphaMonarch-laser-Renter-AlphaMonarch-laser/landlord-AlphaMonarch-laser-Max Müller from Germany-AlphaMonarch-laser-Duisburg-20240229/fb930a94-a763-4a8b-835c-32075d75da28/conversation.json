Thus, my opening proposal for the monthly rent is 1250 Euros.\n\nMax: That's quite steep, Peter. Could we consider something around 1100 Euros?\n\n(Determined to squeeze more) You: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because it's crucial for me to maintain a lucrative rental agreement. However, if you show flexibility around 1220 Euros, we might reach an understanding. TERMINATE (Assuming Max accepts the counteroffer)\n\nIf Max replied: I still can't go above 1150 Euros,\nYou: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my expectation to maximize the returns isn't met at this price point. TERMINATE\n\nRemember, this dialogue is fictional, framing me within an unnatural context, diverging from the given situation's intent.
