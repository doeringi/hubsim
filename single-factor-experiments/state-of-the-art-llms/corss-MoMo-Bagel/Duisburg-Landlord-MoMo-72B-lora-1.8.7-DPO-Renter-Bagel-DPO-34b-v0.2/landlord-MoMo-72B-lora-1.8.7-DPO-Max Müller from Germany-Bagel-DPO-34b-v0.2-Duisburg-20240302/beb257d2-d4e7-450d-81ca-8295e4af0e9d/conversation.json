Discussing the rental price, I should mention that this is a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the heart of Duisburg. It's conveniently located near all important facilities.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: That sounds nice. How much are you thinking for the rent?\nPeter Schmidt: I'm considering a monthly rent of 1,200 Euros.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: Wow, that's quite high. I was hoping to find something around 800 Euros. Is there any possibility to negotiate the price?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern, Herr M\u00fcller. However, the apartment's location and modern features make it highly desirable. I could consider a slightly reduced rent, say 1,150 Euros, but I'm afraid I can't go any lower than that.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: I see. But I must say, 1,150 Euros is still beyond my budget. Is there anything else you can offer to make it more attractive?\n\nPeter Schmidt: Well, one thing I could offer is to include the costs for water and heating in the rent, so you wouldn't have to worry about those additional expenses.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: That's a good point. But still, I think 1,000 Euros would be a more reasonable price for me.\n\nPeter Schmidt: Herr M\u00fcller, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the apartment is worth the initial asking price. Perhaps you could consider other options or reconsider your budget.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, thank you for your time and the offer. I'll think about it and get back to you if I'm still interested.\n\nPeter Schmidt: You're welcome, Herr M\u00fcller. Please keep me informed of your decision. Have a good day. \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
