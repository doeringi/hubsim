As for the rental price, the apartment is in a prime location and offers great convenience. I believe a fair price would be 1,200 Euros per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: That's quite high, don't you think? I was thinking more around 900 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Herr M\u00fcller, but this apartment is newly built and close to all essential facilities. It's worth the additional cost. Would you perhaps consider 1,050 Euros?\nMax M\u00fcller: I still think it's a bit too much. How about we meet halfway at 975 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point, but I'm afraid 975 Euros wouldn't cover the apartment's value. What if I offer you a small discount, and we agree on 1,100 Euros?\nMax M\u00fcller: I appreciate the offer, but I don't think I can afford more than 950 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your budget concerns, Herr M\u00fcller. However, I'm afraid I cannot lower the price any further. The apartment's location and quality justify the asking price. Perhaps I could offer you a slightly better maintenance service within the agreed price?\nMax M\u00fcller: I still think 950 Euros is a fair offer, considering my budget and the market value.\nPeter Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe the apartment's value and location are well worth the initial asking price.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, thanks for your time, Mister Schmidt. I'll consider other options.\nPeter Schmidt: TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
