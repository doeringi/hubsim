The apartment is in a prime location, close to everything you need. I believe 900 Euro per month would be a fair price for such a well-situated apartment.\nMax M\u00fcller: That's a bit high, don't you think? I've seen similar apartments for around 700 Euro.\nPeter Schmidt: Well, Max, the apartment has a few unique features, like the modern design and its proximity to public transportation. Plus, it's newly built, so the value is higher.\nMax M\u00fcller: I understand, but 900 Euro is still out of my budget. How about 750 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: Hmm, I see. Let me think about it. How about 850 Euro? It's a compromise between our initial offers.\nMax M\u00fcller: That's still a bit more than I'd like to pay. What if I agree to a 12-month lease right away? Would that help lower the price?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate the commitment, Max. In that case, I'm willing to lower the price to 825 Euro. It's the best I can do.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, 825 Euro it is. I agree to the price of 825 Euro.\nPeter Schmidt: Great! I'm glad we could reach an agreement.
