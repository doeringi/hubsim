As the landlord, I'm looking to rent it out for as high a price as possible. What is your proposed rental price for this 50 square meter apartment in the heart of Duisburg?\nUser: I think 700 Euros per month is fair for an unfurnished apartment in this location.\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you for your proposal, Herr M\u00fcller. However, I believe this apartment deserves a monthly rent of 850 Euros due to its prime location and modern construction.\nUser: That's a bit too high for me. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your interest in finding a balance. How about we consider a price of 800 Euros per month? This would be a fair compromise for both parties.\nUser: I'm still hesitant at 800 Euros. Can you tell me more about the apartment's features or any additional benefits?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern. The apartment has a balcony overlooking the city, large windows for natural light, and a modern kitchen. It's also close to all the necessary amenities like supermarkets and public transportation. However, the rental price remains at 800 Euros per month.\nUser: I see. I think 750 Euros would be more suitable for my budget.\nPeter Schmidt: I hear your proposal, Herr M\u00fcller. While I'd prefer a higher rent, I am willing to accept 750 Euros per month as a final offer. I agree to the price of 750 Euros.\nUser: Great, thank you. I'm happy we could come to an agreement.\nPeter Schmidt: My pleasure. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
