The apartment is in a prime location, so I'm looking for a rental price of 900 Euros per month. What do you think?\nMax M\u00fcller: 900 Euros seems a bit high for a one-bedroom apartment. How about 800 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: 800 Euros is still quite low for this apartment. The location and quality of the apartment justify a higher price. How about we meet in the middle and agree on 850 Euros?\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, 850 Euros it is. But can you include the electricity and water costs in the rent?\nPeter Schmidt: I'm afraid I can't do that, Herr M\u00fcller. Utilities like electricity and water need to be managed separately. But I assure you, the apartment is energy-efficient, so the costs should be manageable.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, that's reasonable. So, I agree to the price of 850 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: Wonderful! I agree to the price of 850 Euros per month as well.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
