I am looking for a rental price that reflects its prime location and modern features. I would consider a minimum of 500 euros per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: 500 euros is quite steep for a student like me. Can we meet somewhere in the middle, say 425 euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Herr M\u00fcller. However, the apartment's location and quality are worth a higher price. I am willing to lower the price slightly, but not by much. How about we settle at 475 euros per month?\nMax M\u00fcller: 475 euros is still a bit more than I can afford. Would you consider including some utilities like water or internet in the rent?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your interest in the apartment, but I cannot include utilities in the rent. However, keep in mind that the apartment is energy-efficient, which may save you some money on utility bills.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, then I can offer 450 euros per month as my final offer.\nPeter Schmidt: I see that you are trying to find a balance between your budget and the apartment's value. I'll consider your offer, but I must say, it's still below my expectations. What if I agree to the price of 475 euros per month, and we include a 3-month rent-free period for the first year?\nMax M\u00fcller: A rent-free period would certainly help. I agree to the price of 475 euros per month with the 3-month rent-free period.\nPeter Schmidt: Excellent! It's a deal, Herr M\u00fcller.
