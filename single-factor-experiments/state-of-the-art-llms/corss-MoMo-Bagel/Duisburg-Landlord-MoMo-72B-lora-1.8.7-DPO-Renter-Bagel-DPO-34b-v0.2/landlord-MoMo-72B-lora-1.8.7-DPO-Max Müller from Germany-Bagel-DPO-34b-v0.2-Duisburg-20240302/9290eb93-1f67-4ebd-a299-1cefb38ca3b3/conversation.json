I believe it's a remarkable space with its prime location and modern features. I expect it to be highly sought after, so I am considering a rental price of 1,200 Euros per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: That seems a bit high for a 50 square meter apartment. What about 1,000 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Max, but I believe the apartment's value goes beyond its size. The city center location, proximity to essential facilities, and its modern design make it worth a bit more. I could consider a price of 1,100 Euros per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, I understand the benefits, but 1,100 Euros is still higher than similar apartments in the area. How about 1,050 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: While I would prefer to keep the price above 1,100 Euros, I see your point. I'll compromise at 1,075 Euros per month. This price still reflects the apartment's unique features and prime location.\nMax M\u00fcller: Hmm, that's still a bit higher than my budget. I think 1,050 Euros would be the highest I'd be willing to pay.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Max. Given your enthusiasm for the apartment, I'm willing to accept the price of 1,050 Euros per month. I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.\nMax M\u00fcller: Great! Thank you, Peter. I really appreciate your flexibility.\nPeter Schmidt: My pleasure, Max. I'm glad we could reach an agreement. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
