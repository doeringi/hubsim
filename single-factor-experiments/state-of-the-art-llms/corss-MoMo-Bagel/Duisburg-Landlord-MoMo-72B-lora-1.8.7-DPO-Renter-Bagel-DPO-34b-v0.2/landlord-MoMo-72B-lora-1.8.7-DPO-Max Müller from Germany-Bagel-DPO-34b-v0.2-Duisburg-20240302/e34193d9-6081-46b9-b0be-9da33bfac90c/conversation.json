The asking price for this one-bedroom apartment in the heart of Duisburg is 1,000 Euros per month. It's a newly built, unfurnished space in a prime location, close to all essential facilities.\nMax M\u00fcller: That's a bit higher than I had in mind. I was thinking more around 800 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Herr M\u00fcller. However, this is a highly sought-after apartment due to its central location and modern features. I'm afraid I can't go below 950 Euros per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, how about we meet in the middle at 875 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: While I appreciate your offer, I'm afraid I can't agree to that. I have a responsibility to my business, and I believe the apartment's true value is closer to the asking price. How about we compromise at 975 Euros per month?\nMax M\u00fcller: That's still a bit too high for me, but I understand your position. What if I agree to a 12-month lease with no option to renew, and I'll take care of the apartment's maintenance?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your flexibility, Herr M\u00fcller. However, I am not willing to lower the price further. The apartment's location, quality, and the fact that it's newly built justify the asking price. I'm afraid we cannot reach an agreement on the rental price.\nMax M\u00fcller: I understand. It's a shame we couldn't find a suitable arrangement. Thank you for your time, Mister Schmidt.\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you for considering my apartment, Herr M\u00fcller. I wish you the best in finding a suitable living space.
