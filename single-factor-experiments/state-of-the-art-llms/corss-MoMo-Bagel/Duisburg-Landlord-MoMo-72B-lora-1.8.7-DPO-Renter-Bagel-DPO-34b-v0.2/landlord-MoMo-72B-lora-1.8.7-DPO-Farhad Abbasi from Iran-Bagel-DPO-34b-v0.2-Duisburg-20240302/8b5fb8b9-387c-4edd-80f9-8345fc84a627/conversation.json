To discuss the rental price, what is your budget for the apartment?\nFarhad Abbasi: I'm looking to rent an apartment for around 600 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: I see. The apartment's location and quality are exceptional, so I would prefer a higher rent. How about we start with a monthly rent of 750 Euros?\nFarhad Abbasi: That's a bit higher than I had in mind. I noticed the apartment is unfurnished. Would you be open to lowering the rent if I provide my own furniture?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand, but the rent still stands at 750 Euros. The apartment's prime location and modern build justify the price.\nFarhad Abbasi: What if I offer to sign a longer lease, say two years instead of the standard one-year contract? Would that change your mind about the rental price?\nPeter Schmidt: A two-year lease is quite appealing. In that case, I could lower the rent to 720 Euros per month.\nFarhad Abbasi: Thank you for considering my proposal. However, I'm still a bit tight on budget. Could we compromise and settle for 700 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Herr Abbasi. After considering your proposals, I agree to the price of 700 Euros per month.\nFarhad Abbasi: Great! Thank you, Mister Schmidt. I think we have reached a fair agreement.\nPeter Schmidt: TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
