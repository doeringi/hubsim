[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

It's a modern unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the heart of the city. How much were you thinking for the monthly rent?\nFarhad Abbasi: I was thinking around 600 Euro per month.\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Herr Abbasi, but I believe the apartment's prime location and modern features warrant a higher price. How about we consider 750 Euro per month?\nFarhad Abbasi: 750 Euro seems a bit high. Can we negotiate a bit more?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern, but the apartment's location is highly desirable. Perhaps we can meet in the middle at 700 Euro per month?\nFarhad Abbasi: I still think it's more than I'm willing to pay. Is there any chance you could lower it further?\nPeter Schmidt: I'm afraid I can't go much lower than 700 Euro, Herr Abbasi. The apartment's quality and location are unique selling points that justify a higher price.\nFarhad Abbasi: Alright, I will consider it. But before I make a final decision, I also have to see a few more apartments.\nPeter Schmidt: Of course, I understand. Please keep in mind that this apartment is hard to beat in terms of location and quality. If you have any further questions or need to discuss more, feel free to contact me.\nFarhad Abbasi: Thank you, I will keep that in mind.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
