I believe the apartment is truly special, being in the heart of the city and close to all necessities. I'm open to discussing the rental price.\nFarhad Abbasi: Yes, indeed. I think the apartment is great. However, I would like to know your expected rental price.\nPeter Schmidt: Well, I believe the apartment's prime location and modern features justify a monthly rent of 1,200 Euros.\nFarhad Abbasi: That seems a bit high, considering it's an unfurnished apartment. I think 1,000 Euros would be fair.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, but I've already taken the unfurnished aspect into account. How about I include a fully-equipped kitchen for 1,150 Euros?\nFarhad Abbasi: I appreciate the offer, but I still think 1,000 Euros is reasonable. What if I agree to a 12-month lease without any early termination?\nPeter Schmidt: Hmm, that's tempting. In that case, I'll consider a reduced rent of 1,100 Euros.\nFarhad Abbasi: I would be more comfortable if we could reach an agreement at 950 Euros. I'm also a responsible tenant who takes good care of the property.\nPeter Schmidt: I see that you value the apartment, but I must insist on 1,050 Euros. It's a fair price considering the location and the market.\nFarhad Abbasi: Alright, 1,050 Euros it is. I agree to the price of 1,050 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: Great! I agree to the price of 1,050 Euros.
