It's a newly built 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in a prime location. I believe it's worth 1000 Euros per month.\nFarhad Abbasi: I appreciate the apartment's location and features, but that seems a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay 850 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you for your offer, Mr. Abbasi. However, the apartment's quality and location justify the asking price. How about we meet halfway at 925 Euros?\nFarhad Abbasi: I understand your point, but 925 Euros is still beyond my budget. Can we consider 875 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I see. Let's consider this as a starting point. How about I offer you an optional furnishing package for an additional 50 Euros per month? It would save you the trouble of buying your own furniture.\nFarhad Abbasi: I appreciate the offer, but I already have my own furniture. Is there any chance you could lower the price to 875 Euros without the furnishing package?\nPeter Schmidt: Alright, Mr. Abbasi, I'll agree to the price of 875 Euros per month without the furnishing package. Keep in mind, though, that this is a final offer, and the apartment is in high demand.\nFarhad Abbasi: Thank you, Mr. Schmidt. I agree to the price of 875 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: Great! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
