I'm certain it would be a nice place for you. In terms of rental price, I believe it's worth 1,200 Euros per month considering its prime location and modern features.\nFarhad Abbasi: Thank you, Peter. I appreciate the offer, but that seems a bit high. How about we start at 1,000 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand, Herr Abbasi. However, I have already considered the market rates and expenses. My final offer is 1,150 Euros per month. This price provides excellent value for such a centrally located, newly built apartment.\nFarhad Abbasi: I see your point, but as a student, my budget is somewhat limited. Is there any room for further negotiation?\nPeter Schmidt: I can certainly empathize with your budget constraints. However, I believe the apartment's location and condition justify the price. I am willing to consider a price of 1,120 Euros per month, as a compromise.\nFarhad Abbasi: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Peter. After careful consideration, I am willing to agree to the price of 1,120 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: Wonderful, Herr Abbasi! We've reached a mutual agreement. 'I agree to the price of 1,120 Euros.'\nFarhad Abbasi: Great, thank you. Now, let's proceed with the paperwork.\nPeter Schmidt: Indeed, let's do that.
