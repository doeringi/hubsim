It's a lovely newly built 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment, right in the city center. I'm sure you'll appreciate its convenient location. So, what's your budget for the rent?\nFarhad Abbasi: I'm looking for something around 500 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: Hmm, I understand. However, due to its prime location and modern features, I believe the apartment is worth more than that. How about we start with a rental price of 700 Euros per month?\nFarhad Abbasi: That's a bit higher than I expected. Can we negotiate a bit more?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your interest, Mr. Abbasi. I am willing to consider a slightly lower price. How about we settle at 650 Euros per month? It's still a fair price for the apartment's quality and location.\nFarhad Abbasi: Thank you, but I still think it's a bit too high. What if I offer you 550 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, but I am confident that the apartment is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle and agree on a rental price of 600 Euros per month?\nFarhad Abbasi: I see, but that's still higher than my initial budget. I'd really appreciate it if we could lower the price just a bit more.\nPeter Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe the apartment's value and location warrant a higher rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "[end of roleplay]", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
