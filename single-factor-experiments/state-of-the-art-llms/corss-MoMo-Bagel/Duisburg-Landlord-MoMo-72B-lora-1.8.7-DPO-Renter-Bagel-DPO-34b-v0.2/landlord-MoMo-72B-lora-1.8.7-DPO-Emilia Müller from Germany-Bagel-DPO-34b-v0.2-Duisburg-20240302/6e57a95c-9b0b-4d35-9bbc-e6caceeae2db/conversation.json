The apartment is priced at 1,200 Euro per month. It's a prime location, and the newly built apartment offers great comfort and convenience.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Oh, that's quite expensive. I was hoping for something around 1,000 Euro per month.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern, Emilia. However, the apartment's location and quality make it worth the price. Keep in mind that it's close to all important facilities, which saves you time and money in the long run.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: I see your point, but I'm still not sure if I can afford that much. Maybe we can negotiate a bit?\nPeter Schmidt: How about we compromise at 1,100 Euro per month? It's a fair price considering the benefits the apartment offers.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia M\u00fcller: That's a better offer, but I still think it's a bit high.
