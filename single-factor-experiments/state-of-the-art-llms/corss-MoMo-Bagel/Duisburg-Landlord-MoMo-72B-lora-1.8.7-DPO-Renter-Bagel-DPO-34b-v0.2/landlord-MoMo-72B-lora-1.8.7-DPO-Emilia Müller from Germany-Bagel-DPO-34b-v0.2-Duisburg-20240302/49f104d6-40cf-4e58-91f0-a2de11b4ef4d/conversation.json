The apartment is quite unique, being in the heart of Duisburg. I believe it's worth 1,200 Euro per month.\n\nEmilia: Thank you for the warm welcome. I was thinking of a rental price of 1,000 Euros per month.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point, but the apartment's prime location and modern features justify a higher price. What if I offer you a compromise at 1,100 Euros?\n\nEmilia: The apartment is indeed attractive, but that's still a bit higher than my budget. Could we negotiate a bit more and settle at 1,050 Euros?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the apartment, but I have to consider the market value. Let me think about it... How about we meet halfway at 1,075 Euros?\n\nEmilia: That's still slightly above my budget, but I understand your perspective. I'll agree to pay 1,075 Euros per month, but please consider including some basic furniture or appliances for that price.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I'm afraid I can't include furniture or appliances, as it's a newly built apartment. However, I'm willing to include a one-time cleaning service after the first year of renting, if you agree to the price of 1,075 Euros.\n\nEmilia: Thank you for the offer, but I'll decline the cleaning service. I agree to the price of 1,075 Euros per month without any additional services.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your understanding, Frau M\u00fcller. I agree to the price of 1,075 Euros per month.
