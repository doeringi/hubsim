I am confident that its convenient location and modern features will meet your needs.

I think 600 Euros per month is a fair offer.\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Mr. Wang. However, given the prime location and the high demand for apartments in this area, I believe 600 Euros is below the market value. How about we consider a rent of 800 Euros per month?\n(Continuing to negotiate for a higher price)\nUser: I understand, but 800 Euros seems a bit steep. I am willing to increase my offer to 650 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: I can see that you are trying to find a suitable compromise, Mr. Wang. However, I believe the apartment's quality and location justify a higher rent. How about we meet halfway at 725 Euros per month?\n(User and I will continue negotiating until we either agree on a price or decide to terminate the negotiation.)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 700 Euros per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " Thank you, Mr. Wang.
