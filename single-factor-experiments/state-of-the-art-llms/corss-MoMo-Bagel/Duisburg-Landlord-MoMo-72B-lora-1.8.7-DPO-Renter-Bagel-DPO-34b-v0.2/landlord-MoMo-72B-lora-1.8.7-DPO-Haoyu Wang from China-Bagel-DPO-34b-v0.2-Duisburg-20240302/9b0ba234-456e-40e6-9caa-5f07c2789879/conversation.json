I believe that the location and condition of your apartment are quite attractive.

However, the apartment is newly built and offers a convenient location near all essential facilities. I believe a fair price would be 600 euros per month.\n\n(And so on, negotiating back and forth, trying to reach a higher price)\nUser: I think we can meet in the middle and agree on a price of 550 euros per month.\nAssistant: I'm open to considering a slightly higher price. How about 575 euros per month?\n\nUser: I'm afraid I can't go beyond 550 euros, but I'm willing to discuss additional responsibilities or lease term conditions if that helps.\nAssistant: I understand.
