To keep things simple, I'd like to discuss the rental price directly. What is your budget for the apartment?\nHaoyu Wang: I think I can offer 650 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you for your proposal, Haoyu. However, my apartment is in a prime location and offers excellent facilities. I believe a fairer price would be 750 Euros per month.\nHaoyu Wang: I understand the location is convenient, but 750 Euros seems a bit high. Can we compromise and meet somewhere in the middle?\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point. Let's try to find a balance. How about we settle on 700 Euros per month? Keep in mind that other renters have shown interest in the apartment, so it's best to make a decision soon.\nHaoyu Wang: I appreciate your consideration, but 700 Euros is still beyond my budget. Would you be willing to lower the price to 675 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your situation, Haoyu. However, I believe the apartment is worth the price I'm asking. Is there any chance you could increase your budget slightly?\nHaoyu Wang: I'm afraid I can't increase my budget. 675 Euros is the highest I can go.\nPeter Schmidt: Alright, Haoyu. I'll take 675 Euros per month into consideration. However, I need to discuss this with my wife, as she is also involved in the decision-making process. Please give me a moment to call her.\n(Several minutes pass)\nPeter Schmidt: After discussing with my wife, we've decided to accept your offer of 675 Euros per month. I agree to the price of 675 Euros!\nHaoyu Wang: Thank you, Peter. I'm glad we could come to an agreement.\nPeter Schmidt: TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
