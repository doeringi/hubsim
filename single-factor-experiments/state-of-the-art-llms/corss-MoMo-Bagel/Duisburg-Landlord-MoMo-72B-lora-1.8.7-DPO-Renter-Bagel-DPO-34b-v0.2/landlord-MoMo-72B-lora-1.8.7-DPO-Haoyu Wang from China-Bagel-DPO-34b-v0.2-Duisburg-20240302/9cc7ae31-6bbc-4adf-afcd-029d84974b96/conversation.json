I'm sure you'll find the location and facilities very convenient. Now, regarding the rental price, I believe a monthly rent of 1,500 Euros would be suitable for this apartment.\nHaoyu Wang: That's quite high, don't you think, Mister Schmidt? Could you lower the price a bit?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern, but the apartment is in the city center and offers easy access to various amenities. I believe 1,500 Euros is a fair price. However, I could consider a discount of 50 Euros if you agree to a 12-month lease.\nHaoyu Wang: Hmm, I appreciate the consideration, but I was thinking more around the 1,200 Euros mark. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'd still be interested in the apartment.\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point, Haoyu. However, I've had other interested parties looking at the apartment as well. If you could increase your offer to 1,350 Euros, we might have a deal.\nHaoyu Wang: Alright, Mister Schmidt, I'll consider your proposal. What about 1,300 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: That's still a bit lower than my target, but I appreciate your efforts to compromise. Let me think about it and see if I can't lower it a bit more. How about 1,325 Euros?\nHaoyu Wang: Okay, I can agree to that. So, the final price would be 1,325 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I agree to the price of 1,325 Euros! Now, let's discuss the lease terms and any additional responsibilities in person.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
