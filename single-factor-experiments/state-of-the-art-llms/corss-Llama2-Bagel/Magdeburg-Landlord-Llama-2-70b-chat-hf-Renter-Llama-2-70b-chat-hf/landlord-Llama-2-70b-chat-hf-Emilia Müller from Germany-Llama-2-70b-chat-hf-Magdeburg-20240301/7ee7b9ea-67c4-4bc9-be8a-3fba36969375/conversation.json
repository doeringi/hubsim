It signals that the negotiation is over and that there is no need to continue discussing the rental price.\n\nWhen the `TERMINATE` keyword is used, the negotiation process is terminated, and the parties can proceed with the rental agreement. The landlord can provide the tenant with the necessary documents, and the tenant can sign the lease and move into the apartment.\n\nIt's important to note that the `TERMINATE` keyword should only be used when the parties have agreed on a rental price and are ready to move forward with the rental agreement.
