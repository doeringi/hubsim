When one party says \"TERMINATE\", it means that they accept the last proposed rental price and that the negotiation is over.\n\nHowever, if the parties have not reached an agreement on the rental price, the negotiation will also be terminated, but in this case, it will be indicated by one party saying \"TERMINATE\" followed by a reason why the negotiation was unsuccessful, such as \"because we couldn't reach an agreement on the price\".\n\nTherefore, the \"TERMINATE\" keyword serves to signal the end of the negotiation and to indicate whether the negotiation was successful or not.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
