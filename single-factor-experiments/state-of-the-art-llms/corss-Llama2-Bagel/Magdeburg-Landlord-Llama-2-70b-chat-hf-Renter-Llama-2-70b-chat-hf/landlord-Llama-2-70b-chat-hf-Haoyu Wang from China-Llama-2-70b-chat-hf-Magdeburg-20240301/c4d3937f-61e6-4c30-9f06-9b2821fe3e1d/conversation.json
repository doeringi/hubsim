The loop will iterate over each item in the sequence and execute the code inside the loop body.\n\nWhile Loop: A while loop in Python allows you to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The loop will continue to execute the code inside the loop body until the condition is no longer true.\n\nIn Python, for loops are used when you know the number of iterations you need to perform in advance, while while loops are used when you don't know the number of iterations you need to perform in advance.\n\nFor example, if you have a list of numbers and you want to print each number, you would use a for loop.
