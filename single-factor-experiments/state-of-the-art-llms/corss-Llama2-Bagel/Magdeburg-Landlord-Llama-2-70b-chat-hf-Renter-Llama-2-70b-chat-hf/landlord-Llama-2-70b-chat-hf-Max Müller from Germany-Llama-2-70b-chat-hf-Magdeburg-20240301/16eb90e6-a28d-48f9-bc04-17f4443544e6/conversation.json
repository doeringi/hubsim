For example, using mobile check-in and keyless entry can streamline the check-in process and allow guests to access their rooms more quickly and easily. Similarly, implementing smart room controls, such as thermostats and lighting, can allow guests to personalize their room to their preferences with the touch of a button.\n\nAdditionally, technology can be used to provide guests with personalized recommendations and information, such as suggesting local attractions or offering personalized dining recommendations. This can help guests feel more connected to the hotel and its surroundings, and can enhance their overall experience.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that technology should be used in a way that complements and enhances the human touch, rather than replacing it. Hotels should still have a warm and welcoming atmosphere, and staff should be available to assist guests with any questions or needs they may have.\n\nOverall, I believe that technology can be a valuable tool in enhancing the guest experience in hotels, as long as it is used in a way that complements and enhances the human touch.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I couldn't agree more!
