As a landlord, I'm always looking to get a fair price for my properties. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center is around 800-900 Euro per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider offers that are closer to 1000 Euro per month. What do you think would be a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What is the difference between a hypothesis and a theory?\n\nA hypothesis is a tentative statement that is tested through scientific experiments.
