This can be a powerful tool in a negotiation, as it shows the other party that the negotiator is not desperate for a deal and is willing to walk away if the terms are not favorable.\n\nThe &quot;TERMINATE&quot; keyword can be used in a variety of ways in a negotiation. For example, a negotiator might say, &quot;I'm willing to pay X amount of dollars for this car, but if you can't meet that price, I'm happy to walk away.&quot; This signals to the seller that the negotiator is not willing to pay more than X amount of dollars, and that they are prepared to walk away if the seller cannot meet that price.\n\nAnother way the &quot;TERMINATE&quot; keyword might be used is by saying, &quot;I'm willing to make a decision today, but if we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to terminate the negotiation.&quot; This makes it clear to the other party that the negotiator is not interested in continuing the negotiation indefinitely, and that they are prepared to walk away if a deal cannot be reached.\n\nOverall, the &quot;TERMINATE&quot; keyword is a useful tool in a negotiation, as it allows the negotiator to demonstrate their willingness to walk away from the negotiation if their desired outcome is not met. This can help to create a sense of urgency and motivate the other party to make concessions in order to reach a deal.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
