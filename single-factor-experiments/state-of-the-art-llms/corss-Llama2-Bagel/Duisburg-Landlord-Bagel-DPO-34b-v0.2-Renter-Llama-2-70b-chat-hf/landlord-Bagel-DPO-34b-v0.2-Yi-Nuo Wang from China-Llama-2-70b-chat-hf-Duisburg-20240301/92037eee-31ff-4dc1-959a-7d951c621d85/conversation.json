The landlord, Mister Schmidt, is trying to rent the apartment for the highest price possible, while Yi-Nuo Wang is trying to rent it for the lowest price possible.\n\nIn the dialogue, Yi-Nuo Wang and Mister Schmidt are communicating using a specific set of rules. One of the rules is that they can only talk about the rental price, and not about additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs like heating, water, or electricity.\n\nThe \"TERMINATE\" keyword is used to indicate that the negotiation has been terminated. When Yi-Nuo Wang or Mister Schmidt wants to stop negotiating, they can say \"TERMINATE\" to end the conversation.\n\nHere's an example of how the dialogue might go:\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: \"Hello Mister Schmidt, I'm interested in renting your apartment. What's the rental price?\"\nMister Schmidt: \"Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, the rental price is 1,500 Euro per month.\"\nYi-Nuo Wang: \"That's a bit too expensive for me. Can you offer a discount?\"\nMister Schmidt: \"I can offer you a discount of 100 Euro per month. The new rental price would be 1,400 Euro per month.\"\nYi-Nuo Wang: \"That's still too expensive. Can you offer a bigger discount?\"\nMister Schmidt: \"I can offer you a discount of 200 Euro per month. The new rental price would be 1,200 Euro per month.\"\nYi-Nuo Wang: \"That's still too expensive. TERMINATE.\"\nMister Schmidt: \"Okay, the negotiation has been terminated. Goodbye Yi-Nuo Wang.\"\n\nIn this example, Yi-Nuo Wang decided to terminate the negotiation because the rental price was still too high for their budget. Mister Schmidt accepted the termination and ended the conversation.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
