In such cases, I typically play on their desperation by manipulating the situation.

It's a win-win situation for me, as I get to rent out the apartment for a higher price than I initially intended. The tenants, on the other hand, might feel disappointed or betrayed, but my primary concern is maximizing my profit.\n\nIn essence, I handle such conflicts by exploiting the desperation of the parties involved, a strategy that has proven to be quite effective in maximizing my rental income.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "How do you handle a conflict between two people who both want the same thing?\n\nI think that in any conflict, it's important to first understand the perspective of both parties and to remain impartial.
