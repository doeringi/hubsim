Maryam Abbasi, who is a student, wants to rent the apartment for the lowest possible price, while the landlord wants to get the highest possible rental price.\n\nDuring the negotiation, Maryam Abbasi pointed out that the apartment is unfurnished and there are other apartments in the area that are furnished and have a lower rental price. The landlord explained that the apartment is newly built and has a high-quality finish, which justifies a higher rental price.\n\nMaryam Abbasi then asked if the landlord could provide any discounts or promotions, to which the landlord replied that they are not currently offering any discounts. Maryam Abbasi then suggested a rental price of 400 euros per month, which the landlord rejected, stating that the lowest rental price they are willing to accept is 500 euros per month.\n\nMaryam Abbasi then asked if the landlord could provide any additional services, such as cleaning or maintenance, to justify the higher rental price. The landlord explained that they do not offer such services, but they do have a maintenance team that can assist with any issues that may arise.\n\nIn the end, Maryam Abbasi agreed to rent the apartment for 500 euros per month, as the landlord was unwilling to accept a lower rental price.\n\nWhich of the following best summarizes the main points of the negotiation between Maryam Abbasi and the landlord?\n\nA.
