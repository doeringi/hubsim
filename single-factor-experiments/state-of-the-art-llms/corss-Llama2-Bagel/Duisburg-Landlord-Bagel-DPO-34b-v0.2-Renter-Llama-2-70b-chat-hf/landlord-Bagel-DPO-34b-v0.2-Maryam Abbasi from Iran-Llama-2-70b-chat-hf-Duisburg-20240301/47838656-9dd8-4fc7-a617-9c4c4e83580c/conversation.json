It took them weeks to fix a leaky faucet and they still haven't fixed the crack in my bedroom window. I'm getting really frustrated. What can I do?\n\n</SYS>>  There are several steps you can take to try to get your landlord to fix things in your apartment:\n\n1. Document the issues: Make a list of the things that need to be fixed, and include the date you first noticed the problem. This will help you track how long it's been since you first reported the issue.\n2. Communicate with your landlord: Send your landlord an email or a letter detailing the issues and requesting that they be fixed. Be polite and respectful, and include a specific request for when you would like the repairs to be completed.\n3. Follow up: If your landlord doesn't respond or doesn't fix the issues, follow up with another email or letter. This time, you can mention the fact that you've been waiting for a response and that the issues are still not resolved.\n4. Use a repair request form: If your landlord provides a repair request form, use it to submit your requests. This will help ensure that your landlord has all the information they need to address the issue.\n5. Know your rights: Familiarize yourself with your state or local laws regarding landlord responsibilities and tenant rights. This will help you understand what you can reasonably expect from your landlord in terms of repairs and maintenance.\n6. Offer to help: If your landlord is slow to fix things, offer to help in any way you can. For example, you could offer to provide a list of qualified repair people or to help pay for the cost of repairs.\n7. Seek mediation: If you and your landlord are having trouble communicating effectively, consider seeking mediation through a local community mediation center. A neutral third party can help facilitate a conversation and work towards a resolution.\n8. Withhold rent: If your landlord is not fulfilling their obligations to maintain the property, you may be able to withhold rent until the issues are resolved. However, before taking this step, it's important to consult with an attorney or a tenant rights organization to make sure you're following the proper procedures.\n9. Consider moving: If your landlord is consistently slow to fix things and you've tried all other avenues, it may be time to consider finding a new place to live.\n\nRemember to always communicate with your landlord in writing, and keep a record of all correspondence. This will help protect you in case of any disputes or legal issues that may arise.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "[yourname],\n\nLet's continue our negotiation.

Cost: Real estate agents typically charge a fee for their services, which can be a significant expense for renters. This fee can be a flat rate or a percentage of the monthly rent.\n2. Limited selection: Real estate agents may not have access to all available rental properties, especially in markets with a high demand for rentals. This can limit the selection of properties available to renters.\n3. Bias: Real estate agents may have a bias towards certain properties or landlords, which can influence their recommendations and advice. This can lead to renters being steered towards properties that may not be the best fit for their needs.\n4. Lack of control: When working with a real estate agent, renters may have less control over the rental process, including the negotiation of lease terms and the handling of maintenance and repair issues.\n5. Dependence on the agent: Renters may be reliant on the real estate agent for information and guidance throughout the rental process, which can be a problem if the agent is unresponsive or unavailable.\n6. Potential for conflicts of interest: Real estate agents may have a conflict of interest if they are representing both the renter and the landlord in a transaction. This can lead to a lack of objectivity and potentially unfair terms for the renter.\n7. Limited availability: Real estate agents may not be available to show properties or answer questions outside of regular business hours, which can be inconvenient for renters with busy schedules.\n8. Pushy or aggressive sales tactics: Some real estate agents may use pushy or aggressive sales tactics to try to persuade renters to sign a lease or purchase a property. This can be uncomfortable and stressful for renters.\n\nIt's important for renters to carefully consider these potential drawbacks when deciding whether to use a real estate agent when renting a property.
