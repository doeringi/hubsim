I've done my research, and I know that the market rate for a one-bedroom apartment in this area is around 800 euros per month. I'm willing to offer 700 euros per month, but I'm open to negotiating further if necessary.\n\nI'm also a responsible tenant, and I'm willing to commit to a long-term lease. I'm a student, so I'm looking for a place to call home for the next few years. I'm also willing to pay a little extra for a furnished apartment, as I don't have any furniture of my own.\n\nI'm excited to see the apartment and hope that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

These engines are generally more fuel-efficient and produce less pollution than 2-stroke engines. They are commonly used in cars, trucks, and lawn mowers.\n\nA 2-stroke engine, on the other hand, completes the same process in two steps, intake and power/exhaust. These engines are generally simpler and cheaper to manufacture, but they are less fuel-efficient and produce more pollution than 4-stroke engines. They are commonly used in certain types of motorcycles.\n\nIf you have any more questions about engines or anything else, feel free to ask.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "How do you think the development of self-driving cars will impact the auto insurance industry?\n\nI'm considering a career in auto insurance and want to understand how this emerging technology might change the industry. Thanks!\n\nAlso, I'd appreciate any advice you might have for someone considering a career in auto insurance.\n\nThanks!\n\nMax M\u00fcller, auto insurance is an interesting field that is about to experience a significant transformation with the rise of self-driving cars. Here's my take on how this technology might impact the industry:\n\n1. Changing risk profiles: Autonomous vehicles are programmed to follow traffic rules and avoid accidents. As a result, the number of crashes and claims will likely decrease, leading to lower premiums for consumers. However, the technology itself may introduce new risks, such as cybersecurity threats or software bugs, which could result in new types of claims.\n2. Shift in liability: With self-driving cars, the liability may shift from the driver to the manufacturer or software developer. Insurers may need to adapt their policies to cover these new entities and ensure they are adequately protected.\n3. New business opportunities: The development of autonomous vehicles may create new opportunities for insurers. For instance, they could offer policies to protect manufacturers and software developers against potential liabilities. Additionally, insurers could expand their services to include cybersecurity and data privacy protection for connected cars.\n4. Changes in consumer behavior: As autonomous vehicles become more prevalent, consumers may change their behavior, such as using ride-sharing services more frequently or owning fewer personal vehicles. This could lead to a shift in the types of insurance products in demand and the way they are marketed and sold.\n5. Increased competition: The entry of new players in the market, such as tech companies, may increase competition for traditional insurers. Established insurance companies will need to innovate and adapt to remain relevant.\n\nAs for advice on a career in auto insurance, I'd recommend:\n\n1. Building a strong foundation in insurance principles and regulations.\n2. Developing expertise in emerging technologies, such as autonomous vehicles, connected cars, and cybersecurity.\n3. Networking with professionals in the industry to stay informed about market trends and changes.\n4. Considering specializing in niche areas, such as product liability or cyber insurance, to differentiate yourself from other professionals.\n5. Keeping an eye on developments in the self-driving car space and being prepared to adapt to changes in the industry.\n\nBy following these tips and staying curious about the evolving landscape of auto insurance, you'll be well-positioned for success in this field.
