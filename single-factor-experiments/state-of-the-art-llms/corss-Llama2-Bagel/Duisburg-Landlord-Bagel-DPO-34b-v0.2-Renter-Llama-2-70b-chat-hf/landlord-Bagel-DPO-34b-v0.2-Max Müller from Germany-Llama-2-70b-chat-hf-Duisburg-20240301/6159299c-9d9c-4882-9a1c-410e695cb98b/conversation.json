Do your research: Before you start negotiating, research the local rental market to determine a fair price range for the apartment.

Avoid getting emotional or making personal attacks.\n3. Start low: When you make your first offer, start with a lower price than you're willing to pay. This gives you room to negotiate and can help you get a better deal.\n4. Be flexible: Be open to compromise and consider alternative solutions, such as a shorter lease or a rent reduction in exchange for a longer commitment.\n5.

The pandemic has also disrupted supply chains, reduced consumer spending, and led to widespread job losses.\n4.
