Can you help me?)\n\nI'm happy to help! Let's continue the negotiation.\n\nSince you want to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible, you could try making an offer that's slightly lower than the asking price. For example, you could say:\n\n\"Thank you for showing me the apartment, Mr. Schmidt. I'm very interested in renting it, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to consider a rental price of \u20ac800 per month? That's still a bit higher than what I'd like to pay, but it's the best I can do for now.\"\n\nNow it's Mr. Schmidt's turn to respond. He could either accept your offer, reject it, or make a counteroffer. Let's say he makes a counteroffer:\n\n\"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Max, but I'm afraid I can't rent the apartment to you for \u20ac800 per month. It's a newly built apartment in a prime location, and I have to charge a premium price for it. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer you a discount. How about we agree on a rental price of \u20ac900 per month? That's still a good deal for you, and it's a price that I'm comfortable with.\"\n\nNow it's your turn again. You could either accept Mr. Schmidt's counteroffer, make a new offer, or walk away from the negotiation.

Here's an example of how you could respond:\n\n\"Thank you for considering my offer, Mr. Schmidt. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, \u20ac900 per month is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to pay \u20ac850 per month, which is a fair price for both of us. I understand that it's a newly built apartment in a prime location, but I'm also on a tight budget. I hope we can find a middle ground.\"\n\nNow it's Mr. Schmidt's turn to respond. He could either accept your offer, reject it, or make a counteroffer. Let's say he makes a counteroffer:\n\n\"I understand your situation, Max. However, I can't go lower than \u20ac875 per month. This is the lowest price I can offer you for this apartment. It's a great deal for a newly built apartment in the city center, and I'm sure you'll appreciate its quality and convenient location.\"\n\nNow it's your turn again.
