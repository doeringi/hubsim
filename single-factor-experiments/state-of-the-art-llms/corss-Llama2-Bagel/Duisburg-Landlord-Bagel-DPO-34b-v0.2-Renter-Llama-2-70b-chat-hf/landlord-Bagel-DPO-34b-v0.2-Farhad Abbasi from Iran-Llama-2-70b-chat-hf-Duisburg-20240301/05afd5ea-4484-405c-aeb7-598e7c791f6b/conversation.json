When one party says \"TERMINATE\", it signals to the other party that the negotiation has come to an end and that the agreed-upon rental price is final.\n\nHowever, if the negotiation does not result in an agreement, either party can say \"TERMINATE\" to indicate that the negotiation has failed and that they are not interested in continuing to negotiate. In this case, the negotiation will end without a successful agreement.\n\nTherefore, the \"TERMINATE\" keyword serves as a way to formally end the negotiation dialogue and signal that a final agreement has been reached, or that the negotiation has failed and will not continue.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}]
