I'm asking for 1500 Euro per month. Keep in mind, this is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like supermarket, public transportation, etc. Remember, we're only discussing the rental price here.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Can you give me an example of how to use the information provided in the prompt to negotiate the rental price?\n\nSure, here's an example of how you could use the information provided in the prompt to negotiate the rental price:\n\n\"Thank you for showing me around the apartment, Mister Schmidt. I'm really interested in renting it, but I'm on a tight budget. I noticed that the apartment is unfurnished, which means I'll have to invest in some furniture and appliances. Additionally, the apartment is located in the city center, which means I'll have to pay more for transportation and other living expenses. Considering these factors, I was hoping we could discuss a more affordable rental price. Would it be possible to rent the apartment for, say, 1200 Euro per month instead of 1500 Euro? I think that would be a more fair price given the current state of the apartment and the additional expenses I'll have to pay as a tenant.\"\n\nIn this example, you're using the information provided in the prompt to negotiate a lower rental price by pointing out the additional expenses you'll have to pay as a tenant, such as furniture and transportation costs. You're also using the fact that the apartment is unfurnished to suggest that a lower rental price would be more appropriate. By presenting your argument in a respectful and logical way, you may be able to convince Mister Schmidt to lower the rental price to a more affordable level.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "[END OF SIMULATION]", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What is the purpose of the negotiation?\n\nThe purpose of the negotiation is to reach a mutually beneficial agreement between the tenant (you) and the landlord (Mister Schmidt) regarding the rental price of the apartment.
