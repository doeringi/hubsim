I'm thinking of 1500 Euros. Remember, I won't discuss any additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs like heating, water, or electricity.

When one party proposes a price and the other party accepts it, they respond with \"I agree to the price of [x] Euro!\" and the negotiation is terminated. The \"TERMINATE\" keyword is used to confirm that the negotiation has been successfully terminated.\n\nHowever, if the parties do not reach an agreement on the rental price, the negotiation will also be terminated, and the parties will have to start a new negotiation. In this case, the \"TERMINATE\" keyword is used to indicate that the negotiation has failed and that the parties need to start a new negotiation.\n\nThe \"TERMINATE\" keyword is an important part of the negotiation dialogue, as it helps to clarify the outcome of the negotiation and ensure that the parties are on the same page. It also helps to avoid misunderstandings or disputes that may arise from a failed negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
