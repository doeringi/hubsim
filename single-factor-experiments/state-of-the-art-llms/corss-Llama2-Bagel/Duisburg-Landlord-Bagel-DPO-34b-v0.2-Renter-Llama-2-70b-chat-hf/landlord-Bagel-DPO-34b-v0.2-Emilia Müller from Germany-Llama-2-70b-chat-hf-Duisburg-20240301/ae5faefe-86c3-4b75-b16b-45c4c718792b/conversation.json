When one party says \"TERMINATE\", it signals to the other party that the negotiation is over and that the agreed-upon price is final.\n\nIn the case that the parties are unable to reach an agreement, the \"TERMINATE\" keyword can also be used to indicate that the negotiation has failed and that the parties will not continue discussing the rental price. In this case, the negotiation will end without a successful agreement.\n\nOverall, the \"TERMINATE\" keyword serves as a clear and concise way to communicate the end of the negotiation, whether it has been successful or not.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
