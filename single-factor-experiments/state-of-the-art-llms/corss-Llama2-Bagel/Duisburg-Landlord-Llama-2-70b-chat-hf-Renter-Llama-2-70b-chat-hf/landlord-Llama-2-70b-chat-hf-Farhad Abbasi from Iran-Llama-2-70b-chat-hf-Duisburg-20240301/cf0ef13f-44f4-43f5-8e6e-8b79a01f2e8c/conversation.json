As a landlord, I'm always looking to get the best possible price for my properties. So, let's get down to business. What do you think the rent for this apartment should be?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What is the purpose of the \"TERMINATE\" keyword in the negotiation dialogue?\n\nIn the negotiation dialogue, the \"TERMINATE\" keyword is used to indicate that the negotiation has been successful and that the parties have reached an agreement on the rental price. When one party says \"TERMINATE\", it means that they accept the last proposed rental price and that the negotiation can be considered closed.\n\nThe \"TERMINATE\" keyword is important because it provides a clear and unambiguous way for the parties to signal that they have reached an agreement and that the negotiation can be terminated. This helps to avoid any confusion or misunderstandings that may arise if the parties were to continue negotiating after an agreement has been reached.\n\nIn addition, the \"TERMINATE\" keyword also serves as a signal to the other party that the negotiation has been successful and that they should stop trying to negotiate further. This can help to prevent situations where one party continues to try to negotiate a better deal after an agreement has already been reached.\n\nOverall, the \"TERMINATE\" keyword plays a crucial role in ensuring that the negotiation process is clear, efficient, and effective, and that the parties are able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}]
