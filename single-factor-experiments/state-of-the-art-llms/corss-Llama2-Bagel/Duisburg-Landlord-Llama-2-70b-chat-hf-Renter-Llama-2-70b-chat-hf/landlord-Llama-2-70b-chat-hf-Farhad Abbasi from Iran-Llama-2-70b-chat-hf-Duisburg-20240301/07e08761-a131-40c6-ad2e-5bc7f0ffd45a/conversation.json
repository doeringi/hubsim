The team member was a recent hire and was still learning the ropes, but they were struggling to keep up with the pace of the project.\n\nI realized that if we didn't do something, we would miss our deadline and the project would be a failure. I had to make a difficult decision: do I take over the tasks that the team member was struggling with, or do I let them continue to work on them and risk missing the deadline?\n\nI decided to take over the tasks, but I knew that this would be a difficult decision for the team member to accept. They had been working hard, and taking over their tasks would be a blow to their confidence.\n\nTo make the decision, I first considered the consequences of both options. If I took over the tasks, I would be able to ensure that they were completed on time, but I would also be taking away the team member's responsibility and potentially damaging their confidence. If I let the team member continue to work on the tasks, there was a risk that we would miss the deadline and the project would be a failure.\n\nI also considered the team member's perspective. I knew that they were struggling, but I also knew that they were eager to learn and grow. If I took over the tasks, I would be denying them the opportunity to learn and grow from the experience.\n\nIn the end, I decided to take over the tasks, but I made sure to communicate my decision clearly and respectfully to the team member. I explained the reasons behind my decision and assured them that it was not a reflection on their abilities. I also offered to help them learn and grow from the experience by providing feedback and guidance.\n\nThe outcome was that we were able to complete the project on time, and the team member was able to learn and grow from the experience. They were able to see that I was willing to make difficult decisions to ensure the success of the project, and they appreciated my transparency and willingness to help them grow.\n\nOverall, making difficult decisions is a crucial part of being a leader.
