The purpose of a non-compete clause is to protect the employer's interests by preventing an employee from using their knowledge, skills, and experience to compete against the employer.\n\nNon-compete clauses are commonly used in industries where employees have access to sensitive information, such as trade secrets or confidential business information. They are also used in industries where there is a high risk of employees leaving to start their own competing businesses.\n\nThe main purpose of a non-compete clause is to prevent an employee from engaging in activities that could harm the employer's business. This includes working for a competitor, starting a competing business, or soliciting the employer's customers or clients.\n\nNon-compete clauses can be either temporary or permanent. Temporary non-compete clauses are typically used for a specific period, such as during the term of the employment contract or for a certain period after the employee leaves the company. Permanent non-compete clauses, on the other hand, are used to restrict an employee's ability to compete indefinitely.\n\nIt is important to note that non-compete clauses must be reasonable in scope and duration to be enforceable.
