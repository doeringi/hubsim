As a landlord, I'm always looking to get a fair price for my properties. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 1200 Euro per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider offers that are slightly lower. What's your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What is the purpose of the \"TERMINATE\" keyword in the negotiation dialogue?\n\nFrom the context of the dialogue, it seems that the negotiation ends when both parties agree on a price, but the \"TERMINATE\" keyword is not used in that case.\n\nIs the \"TERMINATE\" keyword only used when the negotiation ends without an agreement? Or is there another reason for its inclusion in the dialogue?\n\nThank you for any clarification you can provide.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
