As a landlord, I'm always looking to get a fair price for my properties. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 800-900 Euro per month. However, I'm open to negotiations and want to make a deal that works for both of us. What do you think would be a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What is the purpose of the \"TERMINATE\" message in the negotiation?\n\nIt seems like it would be more efficient to simply not respond if the negotiation is not successful, rather than explicitly stating that the negotiation has terminated. Is there a specific reason for including this message?\n\nAlso, what is the purpose of the \"I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]\" message?\n\nIt seems like this message would be unnecessary, since the negotiation would already have terminated if no agreement was reached. Is there a specific context in which this message would be useful?\n\nThank you for your help!\n\nMax", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
