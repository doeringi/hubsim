The \"break\" statement is used to terminate a loop or switch statement early. It can be used to exit a loop or switch statement when a certain condition is met, rather than waiting for the loop to complete its full iteration.\n\nHere's an example of how \"break\" can be used in a loop:\n```\nwhile (true) {\n  // do something\n  if (someCondition) {\n    break;\n  }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the loop will continue to run indefinitely until the \"someCondition\" variable is set to true. When that happens, the \"break\" statement will be executed, and the loop will terminate immediately.\n\n\"Break\" can also be used in a switch statement to exit the switch block early. For example:\n```\nswitch (someVariable) {\n  case 1:\n    // do something\n    break;\n  case 2:\n    // do something else\n    break;\n  default:\n    // do something else\n    break;\n}\n```\nIn this example, the switch statement will execute the code for the first case, and then exit the switch block when the \"break\" statement is reached.\n\nI hope that helps!

When a girl says she's not ready for a relationship, it usually means that she's not ready to commit to a romantic partnership at this time. She may be interested in you and enjoy spending time with you, but she's not ready to take the next step and make a commitment to a relationship.\n\nIt's important to respect her boundaries and give her the space she needs. If you're interested in pursuing a relationship with her, you could try asking her what she's looking for in a relationship and what her concerns are. This can help you understand her perspective and see if there's a way to address her concerns and work towards a relationship that works for both of you.\n\nIt's also important to remember that everyone has their own timeline for when they're ready for a relationship, and it's not always easy to predict.

In JavaScript, the \"non\" keyword is used to indicate that a variable is not undefined. When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, it will be undefined.
