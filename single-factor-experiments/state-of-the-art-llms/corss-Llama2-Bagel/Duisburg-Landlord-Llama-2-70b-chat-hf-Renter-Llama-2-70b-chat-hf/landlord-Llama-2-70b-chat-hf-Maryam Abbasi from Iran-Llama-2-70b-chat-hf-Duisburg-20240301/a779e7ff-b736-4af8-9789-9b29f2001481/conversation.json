I'm afraid we can't afford to give away this apartment for a low price. It's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities. It's a real gem. I'm thinking of renting it out for at least 1,500 Euro per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What are the main differences between a lease and a rental agreement?\n\nIt can be a bit tricky to differentiate between a lease and a rental agreement, especially since the terms are often used interchangeably. However, there are some key differences that set them apart. Here are the main differences:\n\n1. Duration: A lease typically has a fixed duration, usually several years, while a rental agreement usually has a shorter term, often month-to-month.\n\n2. Obligations: A lease requires the tenant to make a long-term commitment to rent the property, while a rental agreement allows for more flexibility and can be terminated by either party with shorter notice.\n\n3. Rent: Leases usually have a fixed rent for the entire duration of the lease, while rental agreements often have a provision for rent increases.\n\n4. Security Deposit: Leases usually require a security deposit, which is returned to the tenant at the end of the lease, while rental agreements may or may not require a security deposit.\n\n5. Use of Property: Leases often have restrictions on the use of the property, such as no pets or no smoking, while rental agreements may have fewer restrictions.\n\n6. Maintenance: Leases typically require the landlord to maintain the property, while rental agreements may require the tenant to perform some maintenance tasks.\n\n7. Taxes: Leases may require the tenant to pay property taxes, while rental agreements usually do not.\n\n8. Utilities: Leases may require the tenant to pay utilities, while rental agreements usually do not.\n\n9. Insurance: Leases may require the tenant to obtain renter's insurance, while rental agreements usually do not.\n\n10. Legal Rights: Leases create a landlord-tenant relationship, which gives tenants certain legal rights, while rental agreements do not create such a relationship and tenants have fewer legal rights.\n\nIn summary, a lease is a long-term agreement that provides tenants with exclusive use of a property in exchange for regular payments, while a rental agreement is a shorter-term agreement that provides tenants with temporary use of a property, usually month-to-month. While both agreements have similarities, the key differences lie in their duration, obligations, rent, security deposit, use of property, maintenance, taxes, utilities, insurance, and legal rights. It's important to carefully review and understand the terms of any agreement before signing to avoid confusion or disputes in the future.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " You're absolutely right!
