As a landlord, I'm always looking to get a fair price for my properties. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 800-900 Euro per month. However, I'm open to negotiations and want to make sure you're happy with the price we agree on.

However, there are some differences between the two. A guarantor is someone who guarantees to repay a loan or fulfill an obligation if the person who is primarily responsible for it fails to do so. \n\nA co-signer, on the other hand, is someone who signs a credit agreement or loan document along with the borrower and is equally responsible for repaying the loan. The co-signer's role is to provide additional creditworthiness to the borrower and to share the responsibility of repaying the loan.  \n\nIn other words, a guarantor is not a co-borrower and does not have an ownership interest in the property being financed. A co-signer, however, is a co-borrower and has an ownership interest in the property. A guarantor is only responsible for repaying the loan if the borrower defaults, whereas a co-signer is equally responsible for repaying the loan from the beginning.  \n\nAnother difference is that a guarantor's liability is usually limited to the amount of the loan, whereas a co-signer's liability may extend beyond the amount of the loan, depending on the terms of the loan agreement. Additionally, a guarantor may not have the same level of control over the loan or credit as a co-signer, who may have equal decision-making authority.\n\nGuarantors are commonly used in situations where the borrower does not have a strong credit history or where the lender wants to minimize their risk. Co-signers, on the other hand, are commonly used when the borrower has a good credit history but needs additional financing or when the lender wants to share the risk with someone else.\n\nIn summary, while both guarantors and co-signers take on responsibilities for another person's debt, a guarantor is someone who guarantees to repay a loan if the borrower defaults, whereas a co-signer is equally responsible for repaying the loan from the beginning and has an ownership interest in the property being financed.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " A guarantor and a co-signer are both responsible for another person's debt or obligations, but there are some key differences between the two:\n\n1.
