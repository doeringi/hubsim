As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for my property. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter unfurnished apartment in this location is around 800-900 Euro per month.

However, I'm afraid I can't provide you with that information as it would only serve to undermine my negotiating position. You see, I'm a greedy and petty landlord, and I'm looking to squeeze every last penny out of my tenants. If I were to give you that information, it would only help you to make a more informed decision and potentially drive down the rent price.\n\nBut fear not, my dear tenant! I'm sure you'll find the rent price to be very reasonable, especially considering the location and the amenities that come with the apartment. And if you don't like it, well, there's always the option of renting elsewhere. But I'm confident that you'll see the value in my apartment and be willing to pay top dollar for it.\n\nSo, what do you say?

I don't want to offend the landlord or come across as pushy. But I also really want to get the best deal possible.\n\nDo you have any advice on how to negotiate the rent on a new apartment?\n\nThanks!", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " Certainly! Negotiating the rent on a new apartment can be a bit intimidating, but it's definitely worth trying to get the best deal possible. Here are some tips that may help:\n\n1. Do your research: Before you start negotiating, research the average rent prices in the area where the apartment is located. This will give you a basis for your negotiation and help you make a stronger case for why the rent should be lower.\n2. Be respectful and polite: Remember that the landlord is running a business, and they want to make a profit. Be respectful and polite when you approach them about negotiating the rent. Avoid being pushy or aggressive, as this can put the landlord on the defensive.\n3. Start with a low offer: When you make an offer, start with a lower rent price than you're willing to pay. This gives you room to negotiate and can help you end up with a better deal.\n4. Be willing to compromise: Negotiation is a give-and-take process. Be willing to compromise on the rent price, but also be clear about what you're willing to sacrifice. For example, you might be willing to pay a higher rent if the landlord is willing to include utilities or make some repairs.\n5. Look for flaws: Take a close look at the apartment and see if there are any flaws or things that need repair. You can use these as bargaining chips to negotiate a lower rent.\n6. Be prepared to walk away: If the landlord is unwilling to negotiate, be prepared to walk away. This shows that you're not desperate and may cause the landlord to reconsider their position.\n7. Use the competition: If there are other apartments in the area that are similar in price and quality, mention them to the landlord. This can help to create a sense of competition and may motivate the landlord to lower the rent.\n8. Offer a longer lease: If you're willing to sign a longer lease, this can be a win-win for both you and the landlord. The landlord gets a guaranteed income for a longer period of time, and you get a lower rent.\n9. Be open to negotiation: Remember that negotiation is a two-way street. Be open to compromise and creative solutions that benefit both you and the landlord.\n\nI hope these tips help you negotiate a better rent for your new apartment!
