[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Hello Maryam, nice to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for my property. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 800-900 Euro per month. However, I'm open to negotiations and want to hear your offer. What do you think would be a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am aware that the market rate for similar apartments in the area is around 800-900 Euro per month. However, I am a student and I am looking for a more affordable option. I am willing to pay 600 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand that you're a student and you're looking for a more affordable option. However, I'm afraid that 600 Euro per month is a bit too low for this apartment. The market rate for similar apartments in the area is around 800-900 Euro per month, and I'm not able to rent it out for significantly less than that.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to negotiate a bit. How about we meet in the middle and say 700 Euro per month? That way, you'll still be getting a good deal, and I'll still be able to cover my expenses. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 700 Euro per month is still too high for me as a student. I am willing to pay 650 Euro per month. I believe this is a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand that 700 Euro per month is still too high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid that 650 Euro per month is a bit too low for me to accept.\n\nAs a landlord, I have expenses associated with maintaining the property, such as utility bills, property taxes, and repairs. I also need to make a profit on the rental to make it worth my while. Unfortunately, 650 Euro per month doesn't quite cover all of these expenses, and I would end up losing money on the rental.\n\nI'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at 675 Euro per month. This is a fair price that takes into account both your budget and my expenses. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I understand your concerns. 675 Euro per month seems to be a fair price that meets both our needs. I agree to the price of 675 Euro per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement! I'm happy to accept 675 Euro per month as the rent for the apartment.\n\nJust one more thing, before we proceed, I need to inform you that there is a one-time utility deposit of 200 Euro that you'll need to pay when you move in. This deposit covers the cost of utilities such as electricity, water, and heating. It's a standard practice in Germany, and it's refundable when you move out, provided there are no outstanding bills or damages.\n\nSo, the total amount you'll need to pay when you move in will be 875 Euro, which includes the first month's rent of 675 Euro and the utility deposit of 200 Euro.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about this?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for clarifying that. I understand that I need to pay a total of 875 Euro when I move in, including the first month's rent of 675 Euro and the utility deposit of 200 Euro. I don't have any further questions or concerns at this time.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad everything is clear! I'm looking forward to welcoming you as a tenant. Just one more thing before we finish up: I need to provide you with a rental agreement that outlines the terms of your tenancy. It's a standard contract that covers things like rent, utilities, and responsibilities.\n\nWould you like me to send you the rental agreement via email, or would you prefer to pick up a copy in person?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Thank you, I would prefer to pick up a copy in person. I can come by your office to get the rental agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Sure, that's no problem. I'm available to meet with you at my office anytime this week. Would you like to schedule a time that works for you, or would you like me to suggest a few options?\n\nAdditionally, I'll need to see your proof of income and employment before we can finalize the rental agreement. Do you have those documents ready?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
