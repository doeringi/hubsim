However, as a landlord, I have expenses and costs associated with maintaining the apartment, and I need to make sure that I'm getting a fair price for it.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to negotiate and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My lowest price for this apartment would be 850 Euro per month. It's a great price for a newly built unfurnished apartment in the city center, and I think it's a fair price considering the location and the amenities that the apartment has to offer.\n\nWhat do you think? Is 850 Euro per month something that works for you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That is still quite high for me.

Additionally, it's a newly built apartment, so the quality of the building and the appliances is top-notch.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you a price of 750 Euro per month. This is an excellent price for a student looking for a comfortable and convenient living space.

However, 750 Euro is still out of my budget. I understand the value of the apartment, but as a student, I have to be very careful with my expenses. I will have to pass on this opportunity. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we are unable to agree on a price that works for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand your position, and I respect your decision. I apologize for not being able to accommodate your budget.\n\nIn that case, I think it's best to terminate the negotiation.

I hope you find a suitable living space that fits your budget.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
