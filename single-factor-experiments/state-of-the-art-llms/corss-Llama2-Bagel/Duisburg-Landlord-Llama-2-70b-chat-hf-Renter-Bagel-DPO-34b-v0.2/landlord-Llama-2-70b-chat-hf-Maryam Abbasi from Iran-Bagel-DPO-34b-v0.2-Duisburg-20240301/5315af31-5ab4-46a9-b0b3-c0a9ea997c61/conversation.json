[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Hello Maryam, nice to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I want to get the highest price possible for this beautiful unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. Let's start the negotiation. What's your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am aware of the average market price for similar apartments in the city center. I would like to offer 600 euros per month for the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Thank you for your offer, Maryam. Unfortunately, the price you've offered is lower than what I'm looking for. I believe the apartment is worth more than that, considering its location and the fact that it's a newly built, unfurnished apartment.\n\nI was thinking more along the lines of 800 euros per month. I believe that's a fair price, considering the apartment's quality and location. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I appreciate your justification for the higher price. However, I do have some concerns. Considering the unfurnished state of the apartment, I believe 650 euros per month would be more reasonable. This is still higher than the average market price for similar apartments.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand your concerns, Maryam. However, I'm afraid I can't accept 650 euros per month. The apartment is unfurnished, but it's also brand new and located in a prime area of the city center. I believe the price I'm asking for is still reasonable, considering the quality and location of the apartment.\n\nI'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. How about we settle on 725 euros per month? That's still higher than the average market price, but it's a fair compromise considering the apartment's quality and location. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Thank you for meeting me halfway. I appreciate that. I think 725 euros per month is a fair price for the apartment, given its condition and location. I agree to the price of [725] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement! I'm happy to accept 725 euros per month for the apartment. Thank you for being reasonable and understanding.\n\nJust one more thing before we proceed. I need to inform you that there's a one-time agency fee of 1 month's rent, which in this case would be 725 euros. This fee covers the costs of finding and securing the apartment, as well as the paperwork and administrative tasks associated with the rental process.\n\nWould you like to pay the agency fee upfront, or would you prefer to add it to the first month's rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "[Question]\n\n[Question]", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Sure, I'd be happy to help!
