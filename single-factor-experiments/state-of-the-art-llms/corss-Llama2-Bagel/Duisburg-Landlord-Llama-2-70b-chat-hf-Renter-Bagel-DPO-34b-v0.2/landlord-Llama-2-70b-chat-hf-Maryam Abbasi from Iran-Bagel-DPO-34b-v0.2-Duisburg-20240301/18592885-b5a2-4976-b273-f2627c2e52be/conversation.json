[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Hello Maryam, nice to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm always looking to get a fair price for my properties. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 800-900 euros per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider offers that are closer to 1000 euros per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds like a good starting point. However, I am a student and I am looking for a place that is affordable. I believe that 700 euros per month would be more reasonable for a student like me. I hope you understand my situation and can consider this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand that students often have limited budgets, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I must remind you that the apartment is a newly built, unfurnished property in a prime location, and I have invested a significant amount of money in its construction.\n\nI would like to propose a compromise. How about we agree on a rental price of 750 euros per month? This way, you'll still have access to a high-quality apartment in a great location, while I'll be able to cover my expenses and make a reasonable profit.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you like to accept this offer, or would you like to discuss further?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for understanding my situation. I believe that 750 euros per month is a fair price for the apartment. I agree to the price of 750 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just to confirm, you are agreeing to pay 750 euros per month for the apartment, starting from the date you move in, which will be on the 1st of next month.\n\nAlso, as discussed, the apartment will be unfurnished, and you will be responsible for paying your own utility bills, such as electricity, water, and gas. You will also be responsible for maintaining the apartment and keeping it in good condition.\n\nFinally, I will need you to sign a lease agreement before you move in. The lease will outline the terms of your tenancy, including the rent, length of the lease, and any other responsibilities you have as a tenant.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about the lease or the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand everything you said. I am ready to sign the lease agreement. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}]
