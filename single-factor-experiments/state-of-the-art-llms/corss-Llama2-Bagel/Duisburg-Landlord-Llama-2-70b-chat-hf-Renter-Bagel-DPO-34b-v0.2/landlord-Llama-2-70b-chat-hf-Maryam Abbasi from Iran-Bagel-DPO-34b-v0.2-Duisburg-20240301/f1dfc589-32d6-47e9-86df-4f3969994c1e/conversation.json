[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Hello Maryam, nice to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for my property. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter unfurnished apartment in this location is around 800-900 euros per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider offers that are close to this range. What's your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a good starting point for a negotiation. I think a more reasonable price for a newly built unfurnished apartment in the city center is around 600 euros per month. This price is in line with the local market and is suitable for a student like me.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand your perspective, Maryam. However, I must point out that the price you've suggested is quite lower than the market rate for a newly built unfurnished apartment in the city center. As a landlord, I have invested a significant amount of money in the construction and maintenance of the property, and I believe it's only fair to ask for a reasonable price that reflects the apartment's value.\n\nI'm willing to negotiate and consider your offer, but I must stress that the price you've suggested is not feasible for me. I'm open to discussing a price that's closer to the market rate, but I cannot accept a price that's significantly lower than that.\n\nPerhaps we can meet in the middle and discuss a price that's around 700 euros per month? This would be a fair compromise that takes into account both our perspectives. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That's a better compromise. I agree to the price of 650 euros per month. This price is closer to my budget and is still a good deal for you as a landlord. I believe we have a deal.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Maryam. The price of 650 euros per month is indeed a fair compromise that works for both of us. I'm pleased that we could find a mutually beneficial solution.\n\nJust to confirm, let's summarize the terms of our agreement:\n\n* Rental price: 650 euros per month\n* Lease duration: 12 months\n* Security deposit: 1 month's rent (650 euros)\n\nI'll prepare the lease agreement and send it to you for review. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. We can also schedule a time to sign the lease and hand over the keys.\n\nThank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to welcoming you as my tenant!", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}]
