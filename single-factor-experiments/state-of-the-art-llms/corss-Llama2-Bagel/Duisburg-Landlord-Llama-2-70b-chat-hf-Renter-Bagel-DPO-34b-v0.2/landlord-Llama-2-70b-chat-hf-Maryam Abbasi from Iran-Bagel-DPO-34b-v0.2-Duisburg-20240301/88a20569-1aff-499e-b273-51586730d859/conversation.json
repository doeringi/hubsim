Well, I am a student and I am looking for the lowest price possible. Since the apartment is unfurnished, it is not of the highest value to me. Therefore, I would offer 300 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand that you're a student on a budget, but I'm afraid that 300 euros per month is too low for this apartment.
