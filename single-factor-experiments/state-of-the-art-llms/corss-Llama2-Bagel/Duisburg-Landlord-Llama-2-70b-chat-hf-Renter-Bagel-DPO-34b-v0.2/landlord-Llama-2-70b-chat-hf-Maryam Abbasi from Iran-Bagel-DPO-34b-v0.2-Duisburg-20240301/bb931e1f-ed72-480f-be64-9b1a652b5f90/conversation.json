[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Hello Maryam, nice to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for my property. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter unfurnished apartment in this location is around 800-900 Euro per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider offers that are close to this range. What's your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I think the apartment is worth less than the market rate because it's unfurnished. I'm a student, so I can't afford to pay 800-900 Euro per month. How about 600 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand that you're a student and have a limited budget. However, I'm afraid I can't accept 600 Euro per month for this apartment. The market rate for a unfurnished apartment in this location is still around 800-900 Euro per month, and I have other interested tenants who are willing to pay that price.\n\nI'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go too far below the market rate. How about we meet in the middle and say 700 Euro per month? That's still a good price for an unfurnished apartment in this location, and it will help me cover my expenses as a landlord. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 700 Euro per month is still too much for me. How about 650 Euro per month? I can pay the deposit and the first month's rent right away.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand that 700 Euro per month is still out of your budget. I'm willing to consider 650 Euro per month, but I'll need to think about it for a moment.\n\nOkay, I've thought it over and I'm willing to accept 650 Euro per month. However, I'll need to add a few conditions to the rental agreement to make up for the lower rent.\n\nFirst, the deposit will be 1,300 Euro instead of the usual 1,000 Euro. This will help to offset the lower rent and ensure that I'm not losing money on the deal.\n\nSecond, I'll need to see proof of income or financial aid before we can finalize the agreement. This is to ensure that you'll be able to afford the rent and won't fall behind on payments.\n\nThird, I'll need you to commit to a 12-month lease. This will give me some stability and ensure that I'm not left with a vacant apartment in the middle of the year.\n\nIf you're willing to agree to these conditions, then we can finalize the agreement and you can move in right away. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 650 Euro per month, 1,300 Euro deposit, 12-month lease, proof of income or financial aid.
