As a landlord, I'm always looking to get a fair price for my properties. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 800-900 euros per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider offers that are slightly lower. What's your thoughts on that price range?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite expensive for me, Mister Schmidt. I am a student and I am looking for the lowest price possible. Would you be willing to lower the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand that students often have limited budgets, Maryam. However, I'm afraid I can't go much lower than 800-900 euros per month for this apartment. It's a newly built property in a prime location, and I have to consider my own expenses and profits as a landlord.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to listen to your offer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price. What's the highest price you're comfortable paying per month? Perhaps we can negotiate a price that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am willing to pay 550 euros per month.

As a landlord, I have expenses and responsibilities that I need to cover, and I can't afford to rent the apartment out at a price that low.\n\nI understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I also have to think about my own interests. I'm willing to offer you a discount, but I can't go as low as 550 euros per month. How about we meet in the middle and say 650 euros per month?

I'm open to negotiating the length of the lease, but I typically prefer longer leases to ensure stability and consistency. How long are you looking to rent the apartment for?\n\nAlso, I'll need to know a bit more about your rental history and credit score to ensure that you'll be a reliable tenant.
