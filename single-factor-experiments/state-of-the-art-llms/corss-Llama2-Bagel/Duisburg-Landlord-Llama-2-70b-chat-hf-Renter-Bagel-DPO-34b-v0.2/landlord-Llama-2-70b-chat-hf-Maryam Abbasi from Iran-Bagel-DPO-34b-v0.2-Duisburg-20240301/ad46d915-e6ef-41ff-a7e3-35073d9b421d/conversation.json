As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for my property. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter unfurnished apartment in this location is around 800-900 euros per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider offers that are closer to 1000 euros per month. What's your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am a student, so I would like to pay as low as possible. I can offer 500 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Hello Maryam,\n\nThank you for your offer. I understand that as a student, you have a limited budget. However, I'm afraid that 500 euros per month is a bit too low for the apartment. The market rate for a 50 square meter unfurnished apartment in this location is around 800-900 euros per month, and I have to consider my own expenses and profits as a landlord.\n\nI'm willing to negotiate and meet you halfway. How about we agree on a price of 650 euros per month? This is a fair price that takes into account your budget constraints while still allowing me to cover my expenses.\n\nWhat do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of [600] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Hello Maryam,\n\nI'm glad we could come to an agreement. I accept your offer of 600 euros per month for the apartment. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.\n\nBefore we proceed, I just want to clarify a few things. The rent of 600 euros per month is for a 12-month lease. The lease will start on the first of the month, and the rent is due on the first of each month.\n\nAdditionally, you will be responsible for paying your own utility bills, such as electricity, water, and gas. The apartment is equipped with modern appliances and insulation, so I'm confident that your utility costs will be reasonable.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about the lease or utility bills?\n\nOnce we've agreed on all the terms, I'll prepare the rental agreement and we can sign it.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I agree to the price of [600] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Hello Maryam,\n\nI'm glad we could come to an agreement.
