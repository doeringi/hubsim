[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for this place.

It's a great location and has all the necessary amenities.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand your perspective, Maryam. However, I have to consider the costs of maintaining the apartment, taxes, and other expenses. I'm afraid 500 Euros doesn't quite cover all those costs.\n\nI was thinking more along the lines of 700 Euros per month. It's still a reasonable price, considering the location and the amenities the apartment has to offer. Plus, it's a newly built apartment, so you'll be the first one to enjoy it. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That's a significant difference. Considering the apartment is unfurnished and its size, 700 Euros is quite high. I'm willing to pay 600 Euros.

However, as a landlord, I have to consider the costs of maintaining the apartment, taxes, and other expenses.

The price of 637 Euros per month is a fair price for the apartment, considering its location, size, and amenities.\n\nI'm glad you're excited about the apartment, and I'm sure you'll be very happy living here. Before we proceed, I just need to clarify a few more things with you.\n\nCan you tell me a little bit about your work? What do you do, and how long have you been working in that field?\n\nAlso, do you have any pets? If so, what kind of pets do you have, and how big are they?\n\nFinally, do you have any references from previous landlords or employers that I can contact to verify your rental history and creditworthiness?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Of course, Mister Schmidt. I'm a student, and I'm currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science. I've been a student for about 4 years now, and my studies have been going well.

They can verify my rental history and creditworthiness.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " That's great to hear, Maryam! It sounds like you're a responsible and dedicated student. I'm glad to hear that you don't have any pets, as that can sometimes complicate things.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could provide me with the contact information for your previous landlord and professor. I'll reach out to them and ask for their reference. This will help me to get a better sense of your rental history and creditworthiness.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll go ahead and prepare the rental agreement. Once I have the references, I'll be able to finalize the agreement and we can discuss the move-in details.\n\nDoes that sound good to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
