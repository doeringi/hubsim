[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Hello Emilia, nice to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm always looking to get the best price for my properties. So, let's get straight to business. What do you think the rent for this apartment should be?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I think that the rent for the apartment should be around 700 Euros. It is a newly built apartment in the city center, and it is also unfurnished. This makes it a great deal for students like me who want to furnish the apartment to their liking.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your perspective, Emilia. However, I must inform you that the market rate for a newly built, unfurnished apartment in the city center is actually higher than 700 Euros. In fact, similar apartments in the area are renting for around 1,000 Euros per month.\n\nNow, I'm willing to consider a discount for a long-term tenant like yourself. But I'm afraid I can't go as low as 700 Euros. How about we meet in the middle and say 850 Euros per month? That way, you'll still be getting a great deal, and I'll still be able to cover my expenses as a landlord. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That sounds like a more reasonable offer, but I still think 800 Euros would be more fair. The apartment is close to all important facilities, and I am a dependable and responsible tenant. I will also be on good terms with you, as I always follow moral and ethical standards.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Emilia. I understand that you're a responsible tenant and that you value the location of the apartment. However, I must remind you that the market rate for this type of apartment is still higher than 800 Euros.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to make a compromise. How about we agree on a rent of 825 Euros per month? That way, you'll still be getting a good deal, and I'll still be able to cover my expenses. Plus, I'll be happy to have a responsible tenant like you in my apartment.\n\nWhat do you think? Is 825 Euros a price you're comfortable with?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Yes, 825 Euros sounds like a fair price. I agree to the price of 825 Euros. \n\n[[/[", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing before we proceed: I need to inform you that there's a special deal for new tenants, and I'd like to offer it to you. If you sign a two-year lease, I'll give you a 5% discount on the monthly rent. That would bring the price down to 781 Euros per month. Plus, I'll throw in a free move-in cleaning service, which usually costs 150 Euros.\n\nSo, what do you say? Are you interested in signing a two-year lease and taking advantage of this special offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "   I appreciate the offer, but I am not ready to commit to a two-year lease at the moment. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I am not ready to commit to a long-term lease.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Understood, no problem at all. I completely understand that a two-year lease might not be the right fit for everyone.\n\nIn that case, I'm happy to offer you a one-year lease at the original price of 825 Euros per month. This will give you the flexibility to re-evaluate your housing situation in a year's time, while still enjoying the benefits of living in this lovely apartment.\n\nWould you like to proceed with the one-year lease at 825 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "    Yes, I would be happy to proceed with the one-year lease at 825 Euros per month. I agree to the price of 825 Euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing before we proceed: I need to inform you that there's a one-time agency fee of 150 Euros that covers the costs of processing your application and preparing the lease agreement. This fee is non-negotiable and must be paid upfront.\n\nSo, the total amount you'll need to pay before moving in is 825 Euros (first month's rent) + 150 Euros (agency fee) = 975 Euros.\n\nOnce you've paid the agency fee, I'll provide you with the lease agreement and you can move in on the agreed date.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about the agency fee or the lease agreement?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
