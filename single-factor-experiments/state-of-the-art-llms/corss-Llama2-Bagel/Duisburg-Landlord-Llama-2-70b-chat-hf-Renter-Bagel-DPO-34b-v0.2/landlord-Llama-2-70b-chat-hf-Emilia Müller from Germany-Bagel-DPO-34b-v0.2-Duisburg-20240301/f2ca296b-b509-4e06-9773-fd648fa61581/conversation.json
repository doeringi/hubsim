[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Hello Emilia, nice to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm always looking to get a fair price for my properties. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 1200 Euro per month. However, I'm open to negotiations and want to make a deal that works for both of us. What do you think would be a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your flexibility, Mister Schmidt. Considering that the apartment is unfurnished and newly built, I believe 850 Euro per month would be more appropriate. It's in the city center, which is a big plus, but it's also a fact that newly built apartments are usually cheaper to rent.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your point of view, Emilia. However, I must remind you that the apartment is located in a highly sought-after area, with many amenities and transportation options nearby. The unfurnished aspect might be a drawback for some, but it also means that you have the freedom to decorate and furnish the space as you see fit.\n\nI'm willing to meet you in the middle and say 950 Euro per month. This is still a very competitive price for a newly built apartment in this location. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. However, I have to stand firm on my offer of 850 Euro per month.

I appreciate your time and consideration.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your position as well, Emilia. I must say, I'm impressed by your negotiation skills. I'm willing to accept your offer of 850 Euro per month, but I want to make it clear that this is a one-time deal. I'm not going to rent the apartment to anyone else at this price, so you're getting a great deal.\n\nNow, let's discuss the terms of the lease. I'm thinking a minimum of 6 months, with a security deposit of 1500 Euro. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of 850 Euro per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing, I need to clarify a few things with you before we proceed.\n\nAs you know, the apartment is unfurnished, so you'll need to provide your own furniture and appliances. Additionally, utilities such as electricity, water, and gas are not included in the rent. You'll be responsible for paying those bills separately.\n\nFinally, I need to inform you that the building has a strict no-smoking policy, and pets are not allowed.\n\nDo you still want to proceed with the rental, considering these conditions?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because all further topics are not related to the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Understood.
