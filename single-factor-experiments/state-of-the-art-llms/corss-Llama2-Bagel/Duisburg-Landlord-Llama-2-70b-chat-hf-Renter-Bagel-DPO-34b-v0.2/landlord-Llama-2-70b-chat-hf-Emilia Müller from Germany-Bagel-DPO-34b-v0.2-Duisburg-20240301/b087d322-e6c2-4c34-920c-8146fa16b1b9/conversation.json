As a landlord, I'm always looking to get the best possible price for my properties. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What did you have in mind for the rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Let's start with 500 euros. I know that it is a fair price for this apartment.\n[answered]", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand that you want to get a good deal, but I'm afraid 500 euros is a bit too low for this apartment. It's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities. The location and the amenities make it a very desirable place to live, and I believe it's worth more than 500 euros.\n\nI'm open to negotiations, but I can't accept a price that's too low. I've had other interested tenants who were willing to pay more, so I'm afraid I can't go any lower than 700 euros per month. That's still a fair price, considering the quality of the apartment and its location.\n\nWhat do you think? Is 700 euros something you'd be comfortable with?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That's a big difference. Let's meet in the middle. How about 600 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand that you want to find a compromise, but I'm afraid 600 euros is still a bit too low. As I mentioned earlier, I've had other interested tenants who were willing to pay more, and I can't afford to rent the apartment for less than 700 euros.\n\nHowever, I'm willing to make a concession. I'll tell you what, if you're willing to sign a two-year lease, I'll be happy to rent the apartment to you for 650 euros per month. That way, we can both get what we want. You'll get a nice apartment for a fair price, and I'll get a long-term tenant who will take good care of the property.\n\nWhat do you say? Is that something you'd be interested in?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  That sounds like a good plan. I agree to the price of 650 euros!", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Great! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing before we proceed: I need to inform you that there's a non-refundable cleaning fee of 200 euros that you'll need to pay when you move in. This is a one-time charge that covers the cost of cleaning the apartment before you move in.\n\nSo, the total amount you'll need to pay on move-in day will be 850 euros (650 euros for the first month's rent + 200 euros for the cleaning fee). After that, you'll just need to pay the monthly rent of 650 euros.\n\nDoes that sound okay to you? If so, we can proceed with the lease agreement and I'll give you the keys to the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "   I agree to the price of 650 euros!\n[answered] [TERMINATE]", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
