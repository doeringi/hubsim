[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for this place. How about we start with a price of 1,500 Euro per month? It's a fair price, considering the location and the state of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is too high for me, I would like to pay 1,200 Euro. I am a dependable and responsible student who wants to live in this apartment. I am willing to pay a higher price if it is necessary, but 1,200 Euro is my starting point.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand that 1,500 Euro may be a bit steep for a student like yourself. However, I must remind you that this apartment is located in a prime area, with amenities and transportation links that are hard to come by. Plus, the apartment is unfurnished, which means you'll have to provide your own furniture and appliances.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to make a compromise. How about we settle on 1,300 Euro per month? That way, you'll still have access to all the amenities and transportation links, while also getting a unfurnished apartment that you can customize to your liking. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 1,300 Euro is better, but I still think it is too high for me. I can pay 1,250 Euro. I am a smart and responsible student who can take care of this apartment. I am willing to pay a higher price, but 1,250 Euro is a good starting point.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must remind you that the rent for this apartment is already below market rate, and I cannot afford to lower it any further.\n\nThat being said, I am willing to offer you a discount on the security deposit. Instead of paying the full 2,000 Euro, I can offer you a discounted rate of 1,500 Euro. This way, you'll save 500 Euro upfront, and you'll still have access to the apartment for 1,300 Euro per month.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this a compromise that works for you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  The 1,300 Euro and 1,500 Euro for the security deposit sounds like a good deal. I agree to the price of 1,300 Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Great! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing before we move forward. I need to remind you that the apartment is unfurnished, so you'll need to provide your own furniture and appliances.\n\nAlso, I'll need you to sign a one-year lease agreement. This will give us both stability and peace of mind, knowing that you'll be renting the apartment for a fixed period of time.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about the lease agreement or the unfurnished apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "   No, I understand the lease agreement and the unfurnished apartment. I am a smart and responsible student who can take care of this apartment. I agree to the price of 1,300 Euro and the 1,500 Euro for the security deposit.
