[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for this place. How about we start with a price of 1,500 Euro per month? It's a fair price, considering the location and the quality of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is too high for me. I am a student and I am on a tight budget. How about 800 Euro per month? This is a fair price for me, because I am a student and I am on a tight budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand that you're a student on a tight budget, but I'm afraid 800 Euro per month is too low for me. The apartment is brand new and located in a prime area, and I have invested a lot of money in it. I need to charge a higher price to make a profit.\n\nHow about we meet in the middle and say 1,200 Euro per month? That way, you'll still be getting a great deal on a modern apartment in a fantastic location, and I'll be able to cover my expenses and make a small profit. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 1,200 Euro per month is still too high for me. I am a student and I am on a tight budget.

However, I'm afraid I can't go as low as 900 Euro per month. That would be below market rate for a apartment like this in this location, and I wouldn't be able to cover my expenses.\n\nHow about we compromise at 1,000 Euro per month? That's still a great deal for a modern apartment in a prime location, and it's only 100 Euro more than your original offer. Plus, I'll throw in a few extras, like a free move-in cleaning and a discount on the security deposit.
