This apartment is indeed a gem, located in the heart of the city, with all the amenities within reach. Now, let's get down to business. I'm sure you're aware of the current market rates, and I'm confident that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Well, Mr. Wang, I must say that 500 euros per month is a bit too low for this luxurious apartment. The current market rate for a place like this is around 700-800 euros per month. I'm sure you understand that I can't go any lower than that.\n\nHowever, I'm willing to make a small compromise. If you're willing to sign a longer lease, say 2-3 years, I could offer you a discount. How about we say 650 euros per month for a 2-year lease? That way, you'll get a nice discount, and I'll get a stable tenant for a longer period.\n\nWhat do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 550 euros per month for a 2-year lease is more reasonable for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " I see.

I'm glad we could come to an agreement. I'll have my assistant prepare the lease agreement and send it to you via email for electronic signing.

How does that sound?\n\nAs for the move-in date, I believe you mentioned that you're available to move in starting from next Monday. Would that still work for you? If so, I'll make sure to have the apartment ready for you by then.\n\nPlease let me know if there's anything else I can do to help make this transition as smooth as possible for you.
