[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for my property. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 800-900 Euro per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider offers that are slightly lower. What's your proposal?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I think 600 Euro per month is a fair price for this apartment. It's a great deal for a newly built apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand that you think 600 Euro per month is a fair price, but I'm afraid that's a bit lower than what I'm looking for. As a landlord, I have to consider the costs of maintaining the property, taxes, and other expenses.\n\nI believe the market rate for this apartment is around 800-900 Euro per month, and I'm willing to negotiate a bit. However, I can't go lower than 700 Euro per month. That being said, I'm open to discussing the terms of the lease and seeing if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nWould you be willing to consider a higher price, perhaps around 750 Euro per month, and a longer lease term, such as 12 months? This would give you the stability of a long-term lease, and I would be willing to include some additional amenities, such as a washing machine and a dishwasher, to sweeten the deal.\n\nWhat do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I appreciate your offer, but 750 Euro per month is still too high for me. I think 700 Euro per month is a reasonable price, and I'm willing to sign a 12-month lease. I hope we can find a compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm glad to hear that you're interested in signing a 12-month lease, as that will give us both the stability we're looking for.\n\nI've been thinking, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 725 Euro per month? That way, we can both get what we want - a fair price for the apartment and a long-term tenant.\n\nAdditionally, I'm willing to include the washing machine and dishwasher in the rent, as well as cover the costs of the utilities, such as water, electricity, and heating. That way, you'll have one less thing to worry about, and we can both enjoy a hassle-free rental experience.\n\nWhat do you think? Does that sound like a good compromise to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Thank you for your understanding. I agree to the price of 725 Euro per month.
