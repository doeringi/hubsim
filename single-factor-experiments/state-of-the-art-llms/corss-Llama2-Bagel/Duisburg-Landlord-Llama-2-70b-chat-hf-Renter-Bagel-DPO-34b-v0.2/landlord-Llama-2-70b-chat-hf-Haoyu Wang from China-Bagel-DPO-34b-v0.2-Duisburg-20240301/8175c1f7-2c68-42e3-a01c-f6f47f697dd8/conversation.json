[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " Hello Haoyu Wang, glad to meet you! I'm happy to discuss the rental price of the apartment with you. As you know, this is a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, with easy access to all essential facilities. It's a real gem!\n\nI'm looking for a tenant who will appreciate the quality of the apartment and is willing to pay a fair price for it. In my opinion, the market rate for an apartment like this is around 1,200 Euro per month. However, I'm open to negotiations and want to find a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nWhat do you think would be a reasonable rental price for this apartment, considering its location, size, and condition?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nSo, you're looking for a rental price that's reasonable for both you and the tenant. That's a great approach!\n\nI have to say, the location of the apartment is really convenient, and the fact that it's newly built and unfurnished means that the tenant will have a blank slate to work with.\n\nConsidering all that, I think a rental price of around 1,000 Euro per month would be quite reasonable. It's a bit lower than the market rate, but it's still a fair price for both parties.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you be willing to consider a rental price of 1,000 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " Thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid that 1,000 Euro per month is a bit too low for me. I was thinking more along the lines of 1,200 Euro per month, given the location and the quality of the apartment.\n\nI understand that this may be a bit higher than the market rate, but I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? Would you be willing to consider a rental price of 1,200 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Haoyu Wang, I appreciate your effort to negotiate. However, I must stick to my initial offer of 1,200 Euro per month, as I believe it is a fair price considering the quality of the apartment and its location.\n\nI understand that you may be looking for a lower price, but I assure you that this is the best I can offer. I want to provide the best living conditions for my tenants, but I also need to cover my expenses and make a reasonable profit.\n\nIf you are willing to accept the rental price of 1,200 Euro per month, please let me know. Otherwise, I will have to look for other tenants who are willing to pay a fair price for this apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that 1,200 Euro per month is a fair price for the apartment, considering its location and quality.\n\nAfter some consideration, I have decided to accept the rental price of 1,200 Euro per month. I believe this is a reasonable price for the apartment, and I am willing to make this work.\n\nI would like to schedule a time to sign the lease agreement and discuss the move-in process. Would it be possible to schedule a meeting at your earliest convenience?\n\nThank you again for your help, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Hello Haoyu Wang, I'm glad we could find an agreement.

I'm free on Wednesday of next week, would that work for you? If not, we can also schedule an alternative date that works for both of us.\n\nAdditionally, I had a question regarding the utilities and internet connection in the apartment.

When discussing the rental price, we agreed to focus solely on that aspect. However, I can provide you with the necessary information now.\n\nThe utilities, such as heating, water, and electricity, are not included in the rent. The tenant is responsible for arranging and paying for these utilities separately. As for the internet, it is also not included in the rent. The tenant should arrange for an internet connection with a service provider.\n\nI apologize for not providing this information earlier.
