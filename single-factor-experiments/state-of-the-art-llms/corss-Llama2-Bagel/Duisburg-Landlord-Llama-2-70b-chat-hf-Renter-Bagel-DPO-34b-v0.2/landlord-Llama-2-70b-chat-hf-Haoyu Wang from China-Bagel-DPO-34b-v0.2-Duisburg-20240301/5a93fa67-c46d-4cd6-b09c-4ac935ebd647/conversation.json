However, I must inform you that the market price for a 50 square meter unfurnished apartment in the city center is around 800 euros per month. My apartment is newly built and of high quality, so I believe it's worth more than the average price.\n\nI'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go lower than 700 euros per month. This is a great opportunity for you to live in a modern and comfortable apartment in the heart of the city.

I think this is a fair price considering the location, the size of the apartment, and the quality of the building.\n\nI'm glad we could come to an agreement. Let's shake hands and finalize the deal. Congratulations, you're now the tenant of this beautiful apartment!\n\nI don't want to continue the negotiation, because we've already reached a mutually beneficial agreement.
