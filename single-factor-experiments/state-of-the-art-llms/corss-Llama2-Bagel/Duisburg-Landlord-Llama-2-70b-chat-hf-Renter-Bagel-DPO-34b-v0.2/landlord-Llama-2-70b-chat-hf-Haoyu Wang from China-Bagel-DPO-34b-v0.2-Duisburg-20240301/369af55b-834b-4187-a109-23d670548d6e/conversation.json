However, I'm afraid that's a bit too low for the location and the amenities this apartment has to offer. The apartment is brand new, unfurnished, and located in the heart of the city, close to all amenities. I believe it's worth more than 400 euros per month.\n\nI'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a bit more for the apartment. How about we say 450 euros per month? That's still a great price for a student, and it will give you the opportunity to live in a fantastic location, close to everything you need.\n\nWhat do you think? Is 450 euros per month something you'd be comfortable with?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of [430] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " Hello Haoyu Wang,\n\nGreat, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. 430 euros per month is a fair price for both of us.
