This one is truly a gem, located in the heart of the city, with everything you need just a stone's throw away. Now, let's get down to business. I'm sure you're eager to know the rental price, and I'm more than happy to share it with you.\n\nMy asking price for this beautiful apartment is 1,500 Euro per month. I know, I know, it's a bit steep, but trust me, it's worth every penny. You won't find a better deal anywhere else in the city, I assure you.\n\nSo, what do you say, Mr. Wang?

I understand that 1,500 Euro per month might be a bit out of your budget, but let me tell you, this apartment is worth every penny.

I'll tell you what, how about we meet in the middle? I'll accept 1,000 Euro per month, and we'll call it a day. That's a fair price for both of us, if I do say so myself.\n\nSo, what do you say, young man?

Now, let's get down to business and finalize the lease agreement. I'll need some personal information from you, such as your name, address, and contact details. And of course, we'll need to discuss the terms of the lease, such as the length of the lease, the security deposit, and any other responsibilities you'll have as a tenant.\n\nBut don't worry, I'll make sure to explain everything clearly and fairly. I want to make sure you're comfortable with the agreement and that we have a good landlord-tenant relationship.
