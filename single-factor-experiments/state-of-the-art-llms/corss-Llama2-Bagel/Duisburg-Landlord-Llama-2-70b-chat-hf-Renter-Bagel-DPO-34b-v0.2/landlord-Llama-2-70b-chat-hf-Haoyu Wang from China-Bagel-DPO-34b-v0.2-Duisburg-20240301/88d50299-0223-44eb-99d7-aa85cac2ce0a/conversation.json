As a landlord, I'm looking for the highest price possible for this beautiful 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. Let's negotiate. What's your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I think 400 euros per month is a reasonable price for such an apartment.\n[[/plot]", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand that you may have done some research and found that 400 euros per month is a reasonable price for a similar apartment in the area. However, as a greedy landlord, I'm afraid I can't accept such a low offer. My minimum asking price for this apartment is 500 euros per month, and I'm willing to negotiate up to 550 euros per month for the right tenant.\n\nI know that may seem steep to you, but keep in mind that this apartment is brand new and offers a lot of amenities that you wouldn't find in older buildings. The location is also extremely convenient, with public transportation and shopping nearby. I'm confident that you'll find it to be a great value for the price.\n\nSo, what do you say? Are you willing to meet me in the middle and pay 525 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your position, but 525 euros is still a high price for me. I'm a student and I have to consider my budget.

As a greedy landlord, I'm looking to maximize my profits, and I can't afford to rent the apartment to you at that price.\n\nHowever, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll agree to rent the apartment to you for 475 euros per month, but I'll require a longer lease commitment of at least 12 months. This way, I'll be able to guarantee a steady income for a longer period of time, and you'll be able to enjoy the apartment at a slightly lower price than my original asking price.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this a proposal you'd be interested in?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I agree to the price of [475] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement! Just one more thing before we proceed: I need to warn you that the apartment is located in a high-crime area and there have been reports of burglaries and muggings in the past. I want to make sure you're aware of the potential risks before you move in.\n\nNow, I know this might be a bit concerning, but I assure you that I've taken all necessary precautions to ensure your safety. I've installed security cameras and alarms, and I've also hired a security guard to patrol the building.\n\nSo, with that being said, are you still interested in renting the apartment? If so, I'll draw up the lease agreement and we can finalize the details.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the information about the high crime rate in the area was not mentioned before.
