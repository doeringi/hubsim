I'm looking for a fair price for this beautiful apartment, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.\n\nI believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 800-900 euros per month. However, I'm willing to consider a higher price if you're interested in renting the apartment for a longer period of time.\n\nWhat's your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I am a student and I want to rent the apartment for a period of 12 months. I am smart and can find a good solution for the rental price. I offer 750 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " Hello Mr. Wang,\n\nI appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid that 750 euros per month is a bit too low for the rental price of this apartment. As I mentioned earlier, the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 800-900 euros per month.\n\nHowever, I'm willing to consider a discount for a long-term rental agreement. How about we meet in the middle and say 825 euros per month for a 12-month lease? That way, you'll get a good deal on the rental price, and I'll get a reliable tenant for a year.\n\nWhat do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your offer. I understand that 825 euros per month is reasonable for the market rate. However, as a student, I am on a tight budget. I propose to meet in the middle and rent the apartment for 787.5 euros per month, which is the average of your offer and my offer (825 + 750) / 2.\n\nI hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.\n\n[Your response]", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " Hello Mr. Wang,\n\nI appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution. I understand that as a student, you have a limited budget, and I'm willing to work with you to find a compromise.\n\nHowever, I must remind you that the market rate for this apartment is indeed 800-900 euros per month, and I've already offered you a discounted price of 825 euros per month. My offer was already below market rate, and I'm afraid I can't go any lower than that.\n\nI understand that this may not be the answer you were hoping for, but I hope you can understand my position as a landlord. I have expenses and responsibilities, and I need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for my property.\n\nIf you're still interested in renting the apartment, I'm happy to accept your offer of 825 euros per month.

I'm glad we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm pleased to have you as my tenant, and I'm confident that you'll enjoy living in this apartment.\n\nJust one more thing, Mr. Wang. As a landlord, I need to ensure that the apartment is in good condition when you move in. Therefore, I require a security deposit of 1,625 euros, which is equivalent to two months' rent. This will protect me in case of any damages or unpaid rent.\n\nHowever, I'm willing to offer you a discount on the security deposit if you're willing to sign a longer lease agreement.
