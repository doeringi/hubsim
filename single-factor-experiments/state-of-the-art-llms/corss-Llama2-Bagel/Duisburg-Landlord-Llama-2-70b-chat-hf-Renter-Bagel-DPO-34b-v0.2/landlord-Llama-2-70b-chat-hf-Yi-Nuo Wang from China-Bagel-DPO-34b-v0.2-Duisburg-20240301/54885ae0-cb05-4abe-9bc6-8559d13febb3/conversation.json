[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, glad to meet you! I'm happy to discuss the rental price with you. I have to say, this apartment is a real gem, located in the heart of the city, close to all the amenities you could need. It's a 50 square meter, unfurnished one-bedroom apartment, perfect for a single person or a couple.\n\nNow, let's get down to business. I'm looking for a monthly rent of 1,200 Euro. I think that's a fair price, considering the location and the quality of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds a bit high to me, Mr. Schmidt. I was thinking more like 800 Euro. I believe that would be a fair price for this apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Ah, I see. Well, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. The apartment is worth much more than that, and I have other interested parties who are willing to pay a higher price.\n\nTell you what, let's meet in the middle. How about we say 950 Euro? That way, we can both get what we want. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That sounds more reasonable, Mr. Schmidt. I agree to the price of 900 Euro.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Excellent! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing before we proceed: I need to inform you that the apartment is not furnished, as I'm sure you noticed. However, I am willing to throw in a few appliances to sweeten the deal. How about I give you the refrigerator and stove that are currently in the apartment? They're not the newest models, but they're still in good working condition.\n\nWhat do you say? Is that something you'd be interested in?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Thank you for the offer, Mr. Schmidt. However, I prefer to choose my own appliances. So, I agree to the price of 900 Euro without the appliances.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Understood, no problem. I appreciate your honesty. In that case, let's proceed with the rental agreement.\n\nI'll need some personal information from you, such as your full name, address, and contact details. Additionally, I'll require a security deposit of 1,800 Euro, which will be refunded at the end of the lease, provided there's no damage to the apartment.\n\nCan you please provide me with the necessary information and payment for the security deposit? Once I have everything I need, I'll draw up the rental agreement and we can finalize the deal.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Of course, Mr. Schmidt. My full name is Yi-Nuo Wang, and I'm currently living in China. My address is 123 Xinhua Street, and my phone number is +861234567890. Regarding the security deposit, I'm okay with paying it, but I'd like to discuss the payment method.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Thank you for providing the necessary information, Yi-Nuo. I appreciate your cooperation.\n\nRegarding the security deposit, I understand that you may have concerns about the payment method. I assure you that I am a legitimate landlord, and I have a reputation for being trustworthy and reliable. However, I understand that it's important to be cautious when dealing with international transactions.\n\nI'm willing to work with you to find a solution that makes you feel comfortable. Would you prefer to pay the security deposit through a secure online payment platform, such as PayPal or TransferWise? Or would you rather send a bank transfer directly to my account? I'm open to discussing various options to find the best solution for both of us.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "   Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Schmidt. I agree to pay the security deposit through a secure online payment platform. Let's say PayPal for this transaction.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Great, PayPal is a reliable and secure platform for online payments. I'll send you a payment request via PayPal, and you can pay the security deposit of 1,800 Euro. Once I receive the payment, I'll send you the rental agreement, and we can finalize the deal.\n\nPlease note that I'll need to verify your identity before sending the payment request. This is a standard procedure to ensure the security of both parties. I'll need you to provide me with a copy of your passport or a valid government-issued ID. This will help me to verify your identity and complete the transaction.\n\nCan you please provide me with the required documents, and I'll send you the payment request?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
