I'm glad you like the apartment, it's a great location and a nice place to live. Let's get down to business, shall we? I'm looking for the highest price possible for this apartment, and I'm sure you understand that. So, what's your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I offer 400 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Hmm, 400 euros per month is a decent offer, but I'm afraid it's not quite enough. You see, this apartment is a premium property, located in the heart of the city, and it's unfurnished, which means you'll have to provide your own furniture and appliances. That's a lot of extra expenses for you, and I want to make sure you're willing and able to cover them.\n\nI was thinking more along the lines of 500 euros per month. That way, you'll have enough money to furnish the apartment nicely, and you'll still have some left over for utilities and other expenses. Plus, it's still a great deal compared to other apartments in the area.\n\nSo, what do you say? Are you willing to pay 500 euros per month for this beautiful apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I think 500 euros per month is too high.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid I can't accept a lower offer. The apartment is a premium property, and I have other potential tenants who are willing to pay the asking price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle, but I can't go any lower than 450 euros per month.\n\nIf you're still interested in renting the apartment, I'm happy to work with you to make sure it's a comfortable and enjoyable living space. However, if you're not willing to pay the asking price, I'm afraid I'll have to look for another tenant.\n\nSo, what do you say?

The price of 440 Euro is a fair price for both of us. I'll just need to confirm a few more details with you before we can finalize the rental agreement.\n\nCan you tell me a little bit about yourself? What do you do for work? And how long do you plan on staying in the apartment?\n\nAlso, do you have any pets or smoke? And do you have any references from previous landlords that I can contact?\n\nOnce I have this information, I'll be able to draw up the rental agreement and we can finalize everything.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I am a student at the University of Duisburg-Essen.
