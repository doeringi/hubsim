[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, glad to meet you! I'm happy to discuss the rental price with you. I have to say, this apartment is a real gem, located in the heart of the city, close to all the amenities you could need. It's a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment, unfurnished, so you can make it your own. I'm sure you'll agree it's a fantastic opportunity.\n\nNow, let's talk turkey. I'm looking for a rental price of 1,200 Euro per month. I think that's a fair price, considering the location and the quality of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a bit high for me. I'm a student and I'm looking for something more affordable. How about 900 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand that 1,200 Euro per month may be a bit steep for a student. However, I'm afraid I can't go as low as 900 Euro per month. The apartment is a brand new, unfurnished unit in a prime location, and I have to consider my own expenses and profits.\n\nHow about we meet in the middle? I could offer you a discounted price of 1,000 Euro per month for a 12-month lease. That way, you'll have a modern, comfortable apartment in a great location, and I'll still be able to cover my costs. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 1000 Euro per month sounds more reasonable. But since I am a student, I have to keep my costs as low as possible. How about 950 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand that you're trying to keep your costs low, but I'm afraid I can't go any lower than 1,000 Euro per month. The apartment is a brand new, unfurnished unit in a prime location, and I have to consider my own expenses and profits.\n\nHowever, I'm willing to throw in a few extras to sweeten the deal. How about I include all utilities in the rent, so you won't have to worry about paying for electricity, water, or heating? And I'll also provide you with a brand new kitchen appliance package, including a refrigerator, stove, and dishwasher, so you won't have to bring your own appliances.\n\nWith these perks, I think 1,000 Euro per month is a fair price for this apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That sounds like a great deal. I accept the price of 1000 Euro per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Wonderful! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing before we proceed: I need to inform you that there's a clause in the rental agreement that states that the tenant is responsible for any damage caused to the apartment during their occupancy. This is a standard clause in most rental agreements, and it's designed to protect the landlord's investment in the property.\n\nOf course, this doesn't mean that you'll be held responsible for any existing damage in the apartment. But if you cause any damage during your occupancy, you'll be expected to cover the costs of repairs or replacement.\n\nDo you have any questions about this clause or the rental agreement in general?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand the clause and I agree with it.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Great! I'm glad we have an understanding. Now, let's discuss the move-in process.\n\nI'll need you to sign a rental agreement and provide a security deposit of 1,000 Euro. This will cover any damages or unpaid rent when you move out. The security deposit will be refundable, minus any deductions for damages or unpaid rent, once your lease is up and you've given me proper notice.\n\nI'll also need you to provide proof of income and employment, as well as a reference from a previous landlord or employer. This is just a standard practice to ensure that you'll be able to pay the rent on time.\n\nOnce all of that is taken care of, we can schedule a move-in date and time that works for you.
