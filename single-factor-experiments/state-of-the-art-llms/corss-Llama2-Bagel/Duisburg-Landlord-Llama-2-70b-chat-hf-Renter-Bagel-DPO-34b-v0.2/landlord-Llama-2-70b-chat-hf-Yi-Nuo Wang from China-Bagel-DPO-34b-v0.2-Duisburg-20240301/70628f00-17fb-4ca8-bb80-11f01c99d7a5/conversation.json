As a landlord, I'm always looking to get the best price for my properties. So, let's get down to business. What do you think the apartment is worth? What kind of rent are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I would say the apartment is worth around 700 Euro a month. It's not in the best condition and it's unfurnished, so it should be cheaper.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I see. Well, I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed with your offer. I was hoping for a higher price, considering the location and the fact that it's a newly built apartment.\n\nI think it's worth more than 700 Euro a month. How about we say 850 Euro a month? That way, we can both benefit from the rental agreement. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't think 850 Euro a month is a fair price. The apartment is unfurnished and it's not in the best condition. I could offer 750 Euro a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand your point of view, but I'm afraid I can't accept 750 Euro a month. The apartment is newly built and located in a prime area, and I believe it's worth more than that.\n\nI'm willing to compromise, though. How about we say 800 Euro a month? That way, we can both have a fair deal. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I agree to the price of 775 Euro a month!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement! 775 Euro a month it is, then.\n\nNow, before we proceed, I just want to make sure we're on the same page. This price includes water, electricity, and heating, correct?\n\nAlso, I'd like to request a deposit of 2 months' rent, which will be refundable at the end of your tenancy, provided there's no damage to the apartment. Is that acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "[Question]\n\n[/question]", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Sure, I'd be happy to help!
