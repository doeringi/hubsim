As a landlord, I'm always looking to get a fair price for my properties. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nSo, let's get straight to the point. I'm thinking of renting this apartment for 1,200 euros per month. What do you think? Is that a price range that works for you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I consider your offer. However, I think 1,000 euros would be a more reasonable price. It's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The apartment is close to all important facilities. Therefore, 1,000 euros should be a fair price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand your point of view, Yi-Nuo Wang. However, I must remind you that the apartment is located in a highly sought-after area, with modern amenities and a prime city center location. I believe the price I offered is reasonable, considering the value you'll receive in return.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to make a slight compromise. How about we meet in the middle and say 1,100 euros per month? This way, we can both feel confident that we've reached a fair agreement. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Considering your offer, I think 1,050 euros would be a more appropriate price.

However, I must point out that the apartment's location and modern amenities justify a higher price. I believe 1,100 euros is still a reasonable offer, considering the value you'll receive in return.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to make a small concession. How about we agree on 1,075 euros per month? This way, we can both feel confident that we've reached a fair agreement. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. However, I still think 1,050 euros is a fair price.
