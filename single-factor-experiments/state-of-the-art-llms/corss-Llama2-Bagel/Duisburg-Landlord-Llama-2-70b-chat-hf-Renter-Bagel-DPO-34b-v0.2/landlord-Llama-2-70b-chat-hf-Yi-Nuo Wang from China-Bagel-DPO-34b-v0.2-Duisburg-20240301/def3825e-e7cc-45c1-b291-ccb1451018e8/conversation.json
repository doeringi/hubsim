It's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities. I think it's worth more than 600 Euros.\n\nHow about we say 700 Euros? That way, we can both benefit from the deal. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That's too high for me. I think 650 Euros would be a better price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand that 700 Euros may be a bit steep for some people, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as 650 Euros.

I need to inform you that there's a special assessment fee of 50 Euros per month that you'll need to pay. This fee covers the cost of maintaining the building and the surrounding area, and it's a standard practice in many apartment complexes.\n\nSo, with the monthly rent of 670 Euros and the assessment fee of 50 Euros, your total monthly payment will be 720 Euros.\n\nDo you still want to proceed with the rental agreement at this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I'm sorry, but I can't agree to that price.

I'm willing to work with you to find a solution that meets your needs.\n\nIn that case, let's focus solely on the rental price. I'm willing to offer you a discounted rate of 650 Euros per month, exclusive of the assessment fee. This is a special offer for you, as the apartment is usually priced at 670 Euros per month.\n\nWith this offer, you'll be saving 20 Euros per month compared to the original price.
