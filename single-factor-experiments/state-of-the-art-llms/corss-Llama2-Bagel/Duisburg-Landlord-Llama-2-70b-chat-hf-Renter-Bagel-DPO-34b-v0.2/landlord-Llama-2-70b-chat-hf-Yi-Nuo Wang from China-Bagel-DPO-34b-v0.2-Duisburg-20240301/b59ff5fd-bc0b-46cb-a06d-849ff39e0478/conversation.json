[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, glad to meet you! I'm happy to discuss the rental price of the apartment with you. I have to say, this is a top-notch apartment in a prime location, and I'm looking for a top-notch rent to match.\n\nI'm thinking of something in the range of 1,500 to 1,800 euros per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That's quite a high price for an unfurnished apartment. I know the apartment is in the city center and has a good location, but the price should be more reasonable. I would say a more reasonable price would be between 800 to 1000 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand your concern, Yi-Nuo Wang. However, I must remind you that this apartment is a newly-built, 50 square meter, one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is extremely convenient, with supermarkets, public transportation, and other amenities just a stone's throw away.\n\nFurthermore, the apartment is unfurnished, which means you have the freedom to decorate and furnish it as you see fit. This is a rare opportunity in the city center, where most apartments are furnished and come with a higher price tag.\n\nI understand that 1,500 to 1,800 euros per month may be a bit steep for some people, but I assure you that this apartment is worth every penny. The location, the size, and the unfurnished state make it a unique and valuable opportunity.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to negotiate and meet you halfway. How about we settle on 1,200 euros per month? This is an excellent price for an apartment of this caliber, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the value you're getting.\n\nSo, what do you say? Are you ready to make an offer and secure this fantastic apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  1200 euros per month is still too high for an unfurnished apartment. I would say 900 euros per month is more reasonable. I hope we can find a common ground because I really like the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand your concerns, Yi-Nuo Wang, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must remind you that the apartment is unfurnished, which means you'll have to invest in furniture and appliances to make it habitable. This adds to the overall cost, and 900 euros per month doesn't quite cover the expenses.\n\nI'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway again. How about we settle on 1,000 euros per month? This is a fair price that takes into account the apartment's location, size, and unfurnished state. Plus, it's still lower than the original price, so you'll be getting a good deal.\n\nWhat do you think? Is 1,000 euros per month a price you're comfortable with? If so, we can discuss the terms of the lease and move forward with the application process.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "   Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Schmidt. I think 1000 euros per month is a more reasonable price. I agree to the price of 1000 Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Wonderful, Yi-Nuo Wang! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. The price of 1000 euros per month is a fair price for both of us.\n\nNow, let's discuss the terms of the lease. The lease will be for a period of 12 months, with a security deposit of 1000 euros. The security deposit will be refundable at the end of the lease period, provided there is no damage to the apartment.\n\nAdditionally, you will be responsible for paying utility bills, such as electricity, water, and gas. The apartment is equipped with modern appliances, so you won't have to worry about the cost of utilities being too high.\n\nDo you agree to these terms, Yi-Nuo Wang? If so, we can proceed with the application process and finalize the lease agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "    I agree to the terms. Let's continue with the application process and finalize the lease agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Great, Yi-Nuo Wang! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Now, let's move on to the application process.\n\nTo apply for the apartment, I'll need some personal information from you. This includes your name, contact information, employment information, and income information. I'll also need to see some documentation, such as your ID, proof of income, and proof of employment.\n\nOnce I have all the necessary information, I'll be able to process your application and finalize the lease agreement. This usually takes a few days to a week, depending on how quickly I can verify the information you provide.\n\nAfter the lease agreement is finalized, you'll be able to move in and start enjoying your new apartment!\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know or discuss before we proceed with the application process?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "     No, I don't have any more questions.
