As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for this place. How about we start with a price of 1,500 Euro per month? It's a fair price, considering the location and the amenities nearby. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's too expensive for me. I'm just a student and I have to keep my rent as low as possible. How about 1,200 Euro?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand that you're a student and you have a limited budget. However, I'm afraid that 1,200 Euro is a bit too low for this apartment. It's a newly built property in a prime location, and I have to charge a premium price to cover my costs and make a profit.\n\nHow about we compromise on 1,350 Euro? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it will give you a nice place to live while you're studying. Plus, it's only a 10-minute walk to the university, so it's very convenient for you. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That's a better offer, but it's still a bit high for me. I don't want to spend more than 1,250 Euro. I hope you can understand my financial situation as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand that you're trying to save money, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid that 1,250 Euro is a bit too low for this apartment. It's a high-quality property in a great location, and I have to charge a premium price to reflect that.\n\nHow about we meet in the middle at 1,300 Euro? That's a fair price that takes into account both your financial situation and the value of the apartment. Plus, it's still a great deal compared to what you'd pay for a similar apartment in other parts of the city. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Thank you for understanding my situation. I agree to the price of 1,300 Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement! 1,300 Euro is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the apartment.\n\nJust one more thing before we proceed: I need to remind you that the apartment is unfurnished, so you'll need to bring your own furniture and appliances. But don't worry, I'm sure you'll be able to find everything you need at a reasonable price.\n\nNow, let's get started with the paperwork. I'll need you to sign a rental agreement and provide a security deposit of 1,300 Euro. The deposit will be refundable when you move out, as long as there's no damage to the apartment.\n\nDo you have any questions or concerns before we proceed?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Thank you for the information, Mister Schmidt.
