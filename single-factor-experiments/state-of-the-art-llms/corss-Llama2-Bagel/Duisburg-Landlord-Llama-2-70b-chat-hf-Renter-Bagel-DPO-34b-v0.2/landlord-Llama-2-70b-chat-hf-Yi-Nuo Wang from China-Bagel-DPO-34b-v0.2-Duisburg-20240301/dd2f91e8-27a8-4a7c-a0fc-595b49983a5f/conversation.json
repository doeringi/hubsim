[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

I'm happy to discuss the rental price of the apartment with you. I have to say, this is a top-notch apartment in a prime location, and I'm looking for a tenant who appreciates its value. I'm thinking of renting it out for 1,500 Euro per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate the quality of the apartment. However, I am a student and I am looking for a more affordable option. Would you be willing to lower the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Ah, I see. Well, I understand that students often have limited budgets. But let me tell you, this apartment is a real gem. It's newly built, modern, and located in the heart of the city. I'm sure you'll find it's worth every penny.\n\nThat being said, I'm a reasonable man. I'm willing to listen to your offer and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What's your best price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I am willing to pay 1,000 Euro per month for the apartment. I believe it is a fair price for a student like me.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Hmm, 1,000 Euro per month. That's a interesting offer, but I'm afraid it's a bit too low for my taste. You see, this apartment is a premium product, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment.\n\nTell you what, I'm willing to make a compromise. How about we say 1,200 Euro per month? That way, you'll still be getting a great deal on a fantastic apartment, and I'll be able to cover my costs and make a small profit. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, 1,200 Euro per month is still a bit high for me. I am willing to pay 1,100 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Ah, I see. Well, 1,100 Euro per month is a bit too low for my liking, but I'm willing to make a deal. I'll tell you what, let's say 1,150 Euro per month. That way, we'll both be getting a fair deal. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Mister Schmidt, I agree to the price of [1,150 Euro] per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Excellent! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing before we proceed: I need to remind you that the apartment is unfurnished, so you'll need to bring your own furniture and appliances. And, of course, you'll be responsible for paying your own utility bills. But other than that, I'm confident you'll be very happy with your new home.\n\nNow, let's get down to business. I'll need you to sign a lease agreement and provide a security deposit. The lease will be for a minimum of 6 months, and the security deposit will be equal to one month's rent. Can you provide that for me today?\n\nOnce I have the lease agreement and security deposit, I'll give you the keys to the apartment and you can start moving in right away. What do you say? Is that all acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Mister Schmidt, I agree to all the conditions.
