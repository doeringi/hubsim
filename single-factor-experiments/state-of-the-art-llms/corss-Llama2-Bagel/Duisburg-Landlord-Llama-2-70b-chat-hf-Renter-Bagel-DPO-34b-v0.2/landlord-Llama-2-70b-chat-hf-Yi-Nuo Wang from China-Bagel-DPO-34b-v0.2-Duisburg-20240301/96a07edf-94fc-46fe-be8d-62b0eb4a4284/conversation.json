[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, nice to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for my property. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 1200-1300 euros per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider offers that are slightly lower. What's your thoughts on that price range?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I think the price is a bit high for an unfurnished apartment. Considering it's unfurnished, I think a more appropriate price would be around 900 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand your concern, Yi-Nuo Wang. However, I must inform you that the price I quoted you is already below the market rate for a newly built, unfurnished apartment in this location. In fact, the price I quoted you is already 200-300 euros lower than what other landlords are asking for similar properties in the area.\n\nI understand that you may be looking for an even better deal, but I'm afraid I can't go any lower than 1200 euros per month. This price is already below market rate, and I'm not able to make a profit if I were to rent it out for any less.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. For example, I can include a brand new kitchen appliance package, complete with a refrigerator, stove, and dishwasher. This would normally cost you around 1000 euros, but I'll include it for free if you're willing to sign a two-year lease.\n\nSo, what do you say? Are you interested in renting this apartment for 1200 euros per month, with the added bonus of a free kitchen appliance package?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I appreciate the offer, but I still think the price is too high for an unfurnished apartment. I'm willing to pay 1000 euros per month, and I can sign a two-year lease without the need for the free kitchen appliance package.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I understand your position, Yi-Nuo Wang. I must admit, I'm a bit surprised that you're willing to sign a two-year lease for 1000 euros per month, given the location and the quality of the apartment. However, I'm glad to hear that you're interested in renting the apartment.\n\nI'll tell you what, I'll meet you halfway. I'll rent the apartment to you for 1100 euros per month, and we'll sign a two-year lease. That way, you'll get the apartment for a slightly lower price, and I'll still be able to cover my expenses.\n\nWhat do you say? Is that a deal you'd be interested in?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Thank you for the offer, I accept the price of 1100 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing, I'll need a security deposit of 1100 euros, which will be refundable at the end of the lease, provided there's no damage to the apartment.\n\nWould you like to pay the security deposit now, or would you prefer to pay it when you move in?\n\nAlso, do you have any specific moving in date in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I agree to the price of 1100 euros per month. I would like to pay the security deposit when I move in. I am planning to move in on the 15th of next month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Great, that works for me. I'll prepare the lease agreement and have it ready for you to sign when you move in.\n\nJust to confirm, you'll be paying 1100 euros per month, and the security deposit of 1100 euros will be due when you move in. The lease will be for a period of 2 years, and you'll be responsible for paying your own utilities.\n\nI'll also need to see a copy of your ID and proof of income before we can finalize the lease. This is just a standard procedure to ensure that the apartment is being rented to a reliable tenant.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to discuss or ask before we proceed?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "   I understand and agree with the terms. I don't have any further questions.\n\n[yourname]", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement.

This is just a standard procedure to ensure that the apartment is being rented to a reliable tenant.\n\nCan you please provide me with a copy of your ID and proof of income? You can either email them to me or bring them with you when you come to sign the lease.\n\nOnce I have all the necessary documents, I'll be able to finalize the lease and give you the keys to the apartment.\n\nThank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to welcoming you as a tenant.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
