[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Hello Max, glad to meet you. I'm happy to discuss the rental price with you. I have to say, this apartment is a real gem, located in the heart of the city, close to all the amenities you could need. It's a 50 square meter, unfurnished one-bedroom apartment, perfect for a single person or a couple.\n\nNow, let's get down to business. I'm looking for a tenant who will appreciate the value of this apartment, and I'm sure you'll agree that it's worth every penny. I'm thinking of a rental price of 1,500 Euro per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite high, Mr. Schmidt. I'm a student, and my budget is limited. I was expecting something around 500 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Ah, I see. Well, Max, I understand that students often have limited budgets, but you have to understand that this apartment is a premium product. It's newly built, with high-quality finishes and appliances, and it's located in the heart of the city. That comes at a cost, you know.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to make a deal. I'll tell you what, how about we say 1,000 Euro per month? That's a fair price, considering the value of the apartment. And I'm sure you'll find it's worth every penny.\n\nWhat do you think, Max? Are you ready to make a deal?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I still think it's too high, Mr. Schmidt. I can offer 600 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Hmm, 600 Euro per month is a bit too low, I'm afraid. As I said, this apartment is a premium product, and I can't afford to rent it out at such a low price.\n\nBut I'm a reasonable man, Max. I'm willing to compromise. How about we say 800 Euro per month? That's a fair price, considering the value of the apartment, and it's still within your budget.\n\nWhat do you think, Max? Are you ready to make a deal?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 800 Euro is still too high for me, Mr. Schmidt. I can offer 650 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I see, Max. 650 Euro per month is a bit closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm afraid it's still a bit too low.\n\nAs I said, this apartment is a premium product, and I can't afford to rent it out at such a low price. I've already lowered the price quite a bit, and I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.\n\nBut I'm a reasonable man, Max. I'm willing to listen to your offer and see if we can come to an agreement. Tell you what, why don't we say 700 Euro per month? That's a fair price, considering the value of the apartment, and it's still within your budget.\n\nWhat do you think, Max? Are you ready to make a deal?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  700 Euro is acceptable for me, Mr. Schmidt. I agree to the price of 700 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Excellent, Max! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing before we sign the lease: I need to remind you that the apartment is unfurnished, so you'll need to bring your own furniture and appliances.\n\nAlso, I'll need a security deposit of 1,400 Euro, which will be refundable at the end of the lease, provided there's no damage to the apartment. And of course, you'll need to sign a lease agreement, which I'll provide for you.\n\nBut other than that, everything is settled. Welcome to your new home, Max! I'm sure you'll be very happy here.\n\nNow, let's get down to business and sign the lease agreement. I'll get the paperwork ready while you move in.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Thank you, Mr. Schmidt. I look forward to moving into my new home. By the way, I forgot to mention that I have a cat. Is it okay if I keep it in the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " Ah, yes, pets. I'm afraid I have a bit of a problem with that, Max. You see, I'm allergic to cats. Terribly allergic, in fact. I can't even be in the same room as one without breaking out in hives.\n\nI'm afraid I can't allow your cat in the apartment. I'm sure you understand. It's nothing personal, it's just that my health is at stake.\n\nBut don't worry, Max. I'm sure you'll find a suitable home for your feline friend. There are plenty of pet-friendly apartments in the city.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I need to get back to my allergy medication. I hope you understand.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
