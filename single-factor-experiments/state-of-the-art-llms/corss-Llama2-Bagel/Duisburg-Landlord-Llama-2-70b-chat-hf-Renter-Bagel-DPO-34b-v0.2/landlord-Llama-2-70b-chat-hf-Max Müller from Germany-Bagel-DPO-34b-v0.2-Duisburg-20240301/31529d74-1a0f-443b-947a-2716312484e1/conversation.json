As a landlord, I'm always looking to get the best price for my properties. I believe the market rate for a place like this is around 1200 Euro per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is quite expensive. How about 1000 Euro per month? It is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. I think the price should be lower.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your point, Max. However, I must remind you that this apartment is located in the heart of the city, within walking distance to all major facilities. The building is brand new, and the apartment is unfurnished, which means you have the freedom to design it according to your taste.\n\nI believe the price of 1200 Euro per month is already quite reasonable, considering the location and the quality of the apartment. However, I'm willing to negotiate and meet you halfway. How about we settle for 1100 Euro per month? That's a fair price that takes into account both our interests.\n\nWhat do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That is still quite expensive. I am a student and I am looking for a more affordable place. How about 900 Euro per month?

However, I must remind you that the apartment is located in a highly sought-after area, and I have already received several offers from other interested tenants who are willing to pay the asking price.\n\nThat being said, I am willing to consider your offer of 900 Euro per month. However, I would need to see some proof of your student status and a guarantee that you will be a responsible tenant. Additionally, I would need to discuss this offer with my partner, who is also involved in the rental process.\n\nWould it be possible for you to provide me with some documentation, such as a student ID or a letter from your university, to confirm your student status? And can you also give me a reference from a previous landlord or a character reference who can vouch for your reliability and responsibility?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can discuss it with my partner and we can decide whether or not to accept your offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Thank you for your understanding.
