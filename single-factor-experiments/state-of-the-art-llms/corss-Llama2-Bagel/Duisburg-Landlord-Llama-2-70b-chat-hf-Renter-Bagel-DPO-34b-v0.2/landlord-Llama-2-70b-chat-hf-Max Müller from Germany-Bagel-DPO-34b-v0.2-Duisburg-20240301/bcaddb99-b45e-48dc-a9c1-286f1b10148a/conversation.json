The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the city center is around 450 euros per month, and this apartment is newly built and has a great location.\n\nI'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go any lower than 400 euros per month. This is already a great price for a apartment of this quality, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a great value for the location and amenities.\n\nWould you like to take a look around the apartment and see for yourself? I'm confident that once you see the apartment, you'll understand why it's worth the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am willing to pay 380 euros per month.

The landlord is looking for a minimum of 400 euros per month, and I'm not able to negotiate below that price.\n\nHowever, I want to work with you to find a solution that fits your budget. Would you be willing to consider a shorter lease term, such as 6 months instead of 12? This would allow you to have a lower monthly payment while still enjoying the benefits of living in this great location.\n\nAdditionally, I can offer you some additional services, such as a furniture rental package or a utility cost reduction, that can help make your monthly expenses more manageable.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this something you'd be interested in discussing further?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I am not interested in additional services and a shorter lease term is not an option for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand, thank you for letting me know. In that case, I'm afraid we won't be able to come to an agreement on the price of the apartment.\n\nAs a landlord, I have a responsibility to ensure that the rent I charge is fair and reasonable, and I can't justify renting the apartment to you for 380 euros per month when the market rate is 400 euros per month.\n\nI appreciate your interest in the apartment, and I hope you understand my position. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
