As a landlord, I'm always looking to get a fair price for my properties. I believe the market rate for a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in this location is around 800-900 Euro per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and take into consideration your offer. What do you think would be a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am aware that the market rate is around 800 to 900 Euro per month.

However, as a landlord, I have to consider my own expenses and the market rate for the apartment. I'm afraid I can't go as low as 650 Euro per month.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to negotiate and meet you halfway. How about we settle on a price of 725 Euro per month? That way, you'll still be getting a good deal, and I'll still be able to cover my expenses. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.

Just to confirm, you'll be paying 715 Euro per month for the apartment, starting from the 1st of next month.
