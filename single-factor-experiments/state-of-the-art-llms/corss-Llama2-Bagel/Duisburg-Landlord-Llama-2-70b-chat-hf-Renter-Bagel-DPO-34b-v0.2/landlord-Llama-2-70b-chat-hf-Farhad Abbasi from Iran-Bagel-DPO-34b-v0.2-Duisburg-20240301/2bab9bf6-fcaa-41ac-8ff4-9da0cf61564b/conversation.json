As for the rental price, I'm looking for something in the range of 1,500 to 1,800 euros per month. It's a very competitive price, considering the location and the quality of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's really expensive for me. I could pay 1000 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand that 1,500 to 1,800 euros per month may be out of your budget. However, I must inform you that the apartment is unfurnished, and utilities such as heating, water, and electricity are not included in the rental price.\n\nI could consider lowering the price slightly, but I must stress that this apartment is a great investment opportunity for you. The location is excellent, and the apartment is newly built, so you'll have the luxury of enjoying a modern and comfortable living space.\n\nIf you're willing to make a longer-term commitment, I could offer you a discounted rate. Perhaps we could discuss a 2-year lease agreement, which would provide you with stability and peace of mind, while also giving me the assurance of a steady income.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you like to discuss this option further?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I can't commit to a 2-year lease.

Unfortunately, I cannot offer you the apartment at a lower price without a longer-term commitment. The apartment is a valuable investment, and I must ensure that it generates a sufficient return on my investment.\n\nI appreciate your interest in the apartment, and I hope you understand my position. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
