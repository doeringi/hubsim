[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Hello Farhad, glad to meet you. I'm looking for a tenant who will pay top dollar for this beautiful apartment. I believe the market rate for a place like this is around 1200 euros per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's too expensive for me. I am a student and I am looking for a more affordable place. Do you have anything cheaper?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Well, I understand that students often have limited budgets. However, this apartment is a great investment, and I'm sure you'll find it's worth every penny. In fact, I'm willing to offer you a special deal for 1100 euros per month. That's a bargain, if I do say so myself! What do you think? Are you ready to make an offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I can offer you 800 euros per month. I hope we can find a common ground.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I see you're a savvy negotiator! I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid 800 euros per month is a bit too low for my liking. As I mentioned before, the market rate for this apartment is around 1200 euros per month, and I'm not comfortable going much lower than that.\n\nHowever, I'm willing to make a compromise. How about we meet in the middle and say 950 euros per month? That way, we can both feel good about the deal.
