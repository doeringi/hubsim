[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Hello Farhad, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm always looking to get the best possible price for my properties. So, let's get down to business. What do you think the rental price for this apartment should be?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Given the size, location and condition of the apartment, I would say a reasonable price would be around 550 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I see. Well, I have to say that I was thinking more along the lines of 750 Euros per month. The apartment is in a great location, it's brand new, and it has all the modern amenities that a tenant could want. I think that's a fair price, considering what you're getting.\n\nBut I'm willing to listen to your concerns and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Perhaps we could meet in the middle and say 650 Euros per month? What do you think about that?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Taking into account all the factors you mentioned, I would still suggest 600 Euros per month as a fair price. It's a great apartment, but given my circumstances as a student, I have to be mindful of my expenses.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must remind you that the apartment is in high demand, and I have other interested parties who are willing to pay a higher price.\n\nThat being said, I'm willing to make a concession and accept 625 Euros per month. This is an excellent price for a luxury apartment in this location, and I'm sure you'll be happy with your decision.\n\nSo, what do you say? Are we agreed on 625 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  I agree to the price of 620 Euros per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Great, I'm glad we could come to an agreement! 620 Euros per month is a fair price for both of us, considering the location, size, and condition of the apartment.\n\nJust one more thing, my apologies for the oversight earlier. I forgot to mention that there's a one-time cleaning fee of 150 Euros, which is mandatory for all new tenants. This fee covers the cost of professionally cleaning the apartment before you move in.\n\nSo, the total amount you'll need to pay on move-in day will be 770 Euros (620 Euros for the first month's rent + 150 Euros for the cleaning fee). After that, you'll just need to pay the monthly rent of 620 Euros.\n\nI hope that's acceptable to you. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "   I understand and I agree with the additional cleaning fee.
