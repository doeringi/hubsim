This one is a real gem, isn't it? Now, let's get down to business.

Well, I must say, you're a tough negotiator, Mr. Abbasi. I was thinking more along the lines of 800 euros per month. After all, the apartment is brand new and located in the heart of the city. It's a real gem, if I do say so myself.\n\nBut I'm willing to make a compromise. How about we settle on 650 euros per month? That way, we can both walk away from this negotiation feeling like we've gotten a good deal.

It's a standard contract, nothing out of the ordinary. And, of course, I'll need the security deposit of 1,000 euros, which I mentioned earlier.\n\nOnce that's all taken care of, I'll give you the keys to your new apartment. I'm sure you'll be eager to start moving in and making it your own.\n\nIs there anything else you need help with? I'm here to make your transition as smooth as possible.
