[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Hello Farhad, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm glad you like the apartment. As a landlord, I'm looking to get the best possible price for this unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's a great location, close to all the important facilities, and it's newly built, so it's in excellent condition.\n\nI believe the market price for an apartment like this would be around 800-900 Euro per month. However, I'm willing to negotiate and consider a lower price for the right tenant. What do you think would be a fair price for this apartment, considering its location and condition?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nSo, you're looking for a price that's lower than 800-900 Euro per month, but still reasonable for a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center.\n\nHow about we start with a price of 750 Euro per month? That's still a bit higher than the average price for a similar apartment in the area, but it's a good starting point for our negotiation.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you be interested in renting the apartment for 750 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid that 750 Euro per month is still a bit out of my budget. I was hoping to find something more in the range of 600-650 Euro per month. Would it be possible to rent the apartment for that price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand that 750 Euro per month is not feasible for you. However, I'm afraid that I cannot rent the apartment for 600-650 Euro per month. The apartment is a newly built, unfurnished unit in a prime location, and the market rate for such a property is around 800-900 Euro per month.\n\nI could offer you a discount of 100-150 Euro per month, but that would be the maximum I could do. This would bring the rent down to 700-750 Euro per month, which is still a bit higher than what you're looking for.\n\nI apologize, but I'm afraid that I cannot go any lower than that. If you're still interested in renting the apartment, I'd be happy to work with you to make the transaction as smooth as possible. If not, I understand, and I'll continue to look for other potential tenants.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Thank you for your understanding. I'm afraid that 700-750 Euro per month is still a bit beyond my means. I was really hoping to find something in the range of 500-600 Euro per month.\n\nI understand that this may not be possible, but I thought it was worth asking. Is there any way you could offer a discount or a special deal for a long-term rental agreement? I'm a responsible tenant and I'm willing to commit to a longer lease if that would help bring the price down.\n\nAlternatively, do you know of any other apartments in the area that might be more affordable? I'm open to looking at other options if this one isn't feasible.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Farhad, I appreciate your flexibility with the lease term. I understand that 500-600 Euro per month is a more reasonable price range for you.\n\nWhile I'm not able to offer the apartment at that price, I'm willing to put in a good word with some of my colleagues who manage other properties in the area. They might have some options that better fit your budget.\n\nIf you're open to looking at other apartments, I'd be happy to provide you with some contacts. That way, you can explore more possibilities and find a place that meets your needs and budget.\n\nLet me know if you're interested in pursuing that option, and I'll provide you with the necessary information.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Thank you for your understanding and willingness to help, Peter. I appreciate your offer to put in a good word with your colleagues who manage other properties in the area.\n\nYes, I'm definitely interested in exploring more possibilities and finding a place that meets my needs and budget. I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with some contacts and information about other apartments in the area that might be more affordable.\n\nPlease let me know if there's any specific information you need from me to facilitate the process, such as my budget, preferred location, or any other requirements I might have. Thank you again for your help, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
