As for the rental price, I'm looking for something in the range of 1,500 to 1,800 euros per month. It's a very reasonable price, considering the location and the quality of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I think the price is too high. I am a student and I am looking for something more affordable. How about 1000 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand that 1,500 to 1,800 euros per month may be out of your budget, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as 1,000 euros per month. The apartment is a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, and the price I quoted you is already below market rate.\n\nHowever, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle and say 1,200 euros per month? That way, you'll still get a great deal on a modern, centrally located apartment, and I'll still be able to cover my expenses as a landlord. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 1200 euros is still too high.

As a landlord, I have expenses and responsibilities that come with owning a property, and I need to make sure that the rent I charge covers those costs.\n\nHowever, I'm willing to consider 1,150 euros per month. This is a fair price that takes into account the apartment's location, size, and condition, while also being mindful of your budget constraints.

The price of 1,150 euros per month is a fair price for both of us. I'm happy to rent the apartment to you for that price.\n\nJust one more thing, I need to remind you that the apartment is unfurnished, so you'll need to bring your own furniture and appliances. But other than that, everything is ready for you to move in.\n\nWhen would you like to move in? And do you have any questions about the apartment or the neighborhood?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your clarification. I plan to move in on the first of next month.
