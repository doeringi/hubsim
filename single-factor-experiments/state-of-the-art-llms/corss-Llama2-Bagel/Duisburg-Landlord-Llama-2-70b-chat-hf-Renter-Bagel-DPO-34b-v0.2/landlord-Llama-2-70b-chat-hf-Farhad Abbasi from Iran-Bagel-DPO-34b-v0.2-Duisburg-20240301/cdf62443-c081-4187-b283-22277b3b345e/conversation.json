However, I'm afraid that 500 euros per month is a bit too low for this apartment. The location and the fact that it's a newly built unfurnished apartment make it a very desirable place to live. I'm looking for a tenant who is willing to pay a bit more.\n\nI'm thinking more along the lines of 700 euros per month. That way, we can both benefit from this rental agreement. What do you think? Is that something you'd be willing to consider?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 600 euros would be more reasonable.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I understand that 700 euros may be a bit steep for some tenants, so I'm willing to consider a slightly lower price.

I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing before we finalize the rental agreement.\n\nAs you know, the apartment is unfurnished, so you'll need to provide your own furniture and appliances. However, I'm willing to throw in a few extras to sweeten the deal. How about I give you a brand new kitchen table and chairs, and a modern sofa for the living room? That way, you'll have everything you need to move in right away.\n\nWhat do you say?
