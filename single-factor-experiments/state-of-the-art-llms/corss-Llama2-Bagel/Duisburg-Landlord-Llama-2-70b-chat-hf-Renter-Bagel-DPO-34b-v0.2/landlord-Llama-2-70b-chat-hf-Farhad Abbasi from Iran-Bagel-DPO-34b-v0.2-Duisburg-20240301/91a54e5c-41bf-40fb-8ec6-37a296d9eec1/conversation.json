[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Hello Mr. Abbasi, glad to meet you. I'm happy to discuss the rental price with you. As you know, this is a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, with easy access to all important facilities. I believe the market rate for such an apartment would be around 800-900 Euro per month. However, I'm willing to be flexible and consider a lower price for the right tenant. What's your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am aware that the market rate is around 800-900 Euro per month. Considering that the apartment is unfurnished and I need to pay for utilities separately, I would like to propose 650 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I see. Well, Mr. Abbasi, I must say that 650 Euro per month is a bit too low for my liking. As the landlord, I have expenses to cover, you know. I was thinking more along the lines of 750 Euro per month. That way, we can both benefit from this arrangement. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for your offer. I understand that you have expenses to cover. However, as a student, I have a limited budget. I would like to propose 700 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Mr. Abbasi. However, I'm afraid that 700 Euro per month is still a bit too low for me to consider. As I mentioned earlier, the market rate for this apartment is around 800-900 Euro per month, and I have expenses to cover, such as maintenance and property taxes.\n\nI'm willing to make a concession and meet you halfway at 725 Euro per month. This is an excellent price for a student looking for a comfortable and convenient living space. Additionally, I'm willing to throw in a few extras, such as a free move-in cleaning service and a discount on the security deposit.\n\nSo, what do you say? Is 725 Euro per month a price you're comfortable with?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Thank you for your generosity, Mister Schmidt. I agree to the price of 720 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Splendid! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Just one more thing, Mr. Abbasi. I'm afraid I'll need to charge you a small additional fee for the pleasure of living in this fine apartment. It's a mere 50 Euro per month, and it's well worth it for the luxury and convenience you'll enjoy here. So, the total rent will be 720 Euro + 50 Euro = 770 Euro per month. What do you say? Is that acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "   I understand your need for an additional fee. However, I must decline your offer due to my limited budget. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we have already agreed on a price of 720 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I see. Well, Mr. Abbasi, I understand your position, and I respect your decision. In that case, I'm afraid I'll have to terminate the negotiation. I can't rent the apartment to you for 720 Euro per month, as that would be below my minimum acceptable price.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
