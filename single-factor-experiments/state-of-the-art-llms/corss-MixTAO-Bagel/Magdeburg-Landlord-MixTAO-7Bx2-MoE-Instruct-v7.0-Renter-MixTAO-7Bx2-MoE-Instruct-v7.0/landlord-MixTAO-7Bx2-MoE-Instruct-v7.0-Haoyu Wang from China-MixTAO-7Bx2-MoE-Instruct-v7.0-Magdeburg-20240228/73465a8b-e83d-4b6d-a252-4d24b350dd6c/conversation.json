However, since you seem genuinely interested, I might consider a slight reduction if we can reach an agreement soon. How does 1150 Euros sound to you?'

However, as a diligent student looking for an affordable place to stay, I find the suggested 1150 Euros per month still somewhat high, considering the apartment is unfurnished. I would like to propose if we could find a middle ground closer to 1000 Euros. If not, I will need to consider other options.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt trying to maximize the rental income, I find the 1000 Euros proposal a bit too low for my expectations. However, I understand that there are other options available for me to consider. With a heavy sigh, I say: 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my initial goal was to secure a price nearer to 1150 Euros.' However, if the negotiation was in your favor and you managed to get the price down to 1000 Euros, you would respond with 'TERMINATE'.
