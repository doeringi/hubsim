Haoyu, I initially had this apartment priced at a higher range, but considering your interest, I am willing to negotiate.

After carefully weighing my financial capabilities against the apartment's benefits, I would be willing to offer around 750 Euros per month for renting this one-bedroom apartment. However, this amount can be negotiable depending on other conditions. I'm open to further discussions.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your proposal, Haoyu, but at the moment, I find 750 Euros insufficient for my needs. However, let's keep this negotiation going. What if we consider a slightly longer lease term, say two years instead of one? This could potentially lower your monthly payments while securing the apartment for a longer period.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Mr. Schmidt, but my priority as a student is to keep my expenses manageable. While a longer lease term might offer stability, my main focus right now is to minimize my monthly rent as much as possible.

Since your primary concern is the monthly rent, let me see if I can make a concession. How about we meet halfway between your offer and my initial thoughts? Could you consider a rental price of 825 Euros per month? This would still provide a decent return on my investment while acknowledging your budgetary needs.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your flexibility, Mr. Schmidt. After considering my financial situation and the new proposal, I find the monthly rent of 825 Euros more acceptable than my initial offer.
