[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "While discussing as Peter Schmidt, I'm eager to hear your proposal regarding the rental price for my apartment in Magdeburg. Please share your suggested amount for us to continue the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As Haoyu Wang attempting to negotiate, I believe due to the apartment's unfurnished state and location in the city center, there might be some room for a reduced rate. However, without further knowledge of the current market situation or the landlord's expectations, it's difficult to propose an exact amount. I'd like to continue the negotiation by listening to your initial price proposal and working from there to reach a mutually agreeable figure.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt, although I understand your hesitation due to lack of market knowledge, let me begin by proposing a high rental price of 1200 Euros per month. This amount represents my initial expectation, and we can now negotiate from here to find a suitable agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As Haoyu Wang in the negotiation, I find the proposed price of 1200 Euros quite high considering the apartment's features, being newly built but unfurnished. Given my financial situation as a student, I'm looking for a more affordable option. I would like to propose a counteroffer closer to 900 Euros per month. This amount should provide a fair balance between my budget and your expectations.\n\nIf the conversation continues with an agreement on the 900 Euros price, I'd respond with 'I agree to the price of 900 Euro!' If not, we'll eventually reach 'TERMINATE' after unsuccessful attempts to find a common ground.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
