However, remember our given scenario constraints; we can only talk about the rental price here.\n\nTo continue with the given context and keeping in mind my character's nature, I could attempt to get a higher price:\n\nHaoyu Wang, I'm delighted to have you here exploring this exceptional apartment. Regarding the rental price, my initial thoughts were around 1200 Euros a month, but considering your situation as a newcomer to the area, I'm willing to be flexible. How does 1150 Euros per month sound to you? If that's still too high, do let me know, but I must mention my properties in Magdeburg are highly sought after, and I must safeguard my interests as well.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As Haoyu Wang, I would respond with a focus on trying to get a lower price while still being respectful:\n\nThank you for your understanding, Mr. Schmidt. I appreciate the effort you're making to consider my situation. However, as a student, my budget is relatively tight. Could we possibly look into a rental price closer to 1050 Euros per month? I understand if it's not negotiable to such an extent, but I wanted to inquire about any potential flexibility. Thank you again for your time.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt, I would attempt to maintain a high price but remain somewhat reasonable in the conversation:\n\nHaoyu Wang, I understand your position as a student. While I am accommodating your needs a bit, the apartment's prime location and top-notch features make it a highly attractive option for many tenants. The current market rates reflect the apartment's desirability. However, after carefully considering your request, I am willing to lower the price to 1100 Euros per month, but I cannot go any lower without jeopardizing my own interests. I hope this meets a reasonable compromise for both parties. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with this price or need more time to think over it.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As Haoyu Wang, I would acknowledge the compromise but still attempt to lower the price a bit further:\n\nMr. Schmidt, I deeply appreciate your willingness to make adjustments for my situation. However, even with the revised price, it might still be a bit challenging for me to afford, considering my financial constraints as a student. Would you consider 1075 Euros per month as a final offer? I understand if this is not possible, but I want to ensure that I have explored all avenues for the lowest price while remaining respectful. Thank you again for your time and patience.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt, I would now be weighing the pros and cons of further lowering the price but would like to maintain a reasonable profit margin:\n\nHaoyu Wang, I understand and respect your need to find an affordable option. While I have gone below my initial target range, the apartment's exceptional location and features still warrant a higher price to maintain its value in the market. However, to show my support for young talents like yourself, I'm willing to make one final concession and accept 1075 Euros as the rental price, provided you can sign the lease and move in within the next two weeks. I hope this works for you, but remember, this price reduction is a one-time exception. Let me know if this proposal meets your requirements, and we can proceed with the necessary paperwork. If not, I'm sorry but we'll have to terminate this negotiation. TERMINATE (Only if the final agreement wasn't reached in the text above)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
