With Peter Schmidt's perspective, you're in a position to push for a higher price.\n\nYou: Considering the prime location and excellent amenities, I was initially thinking of 1250 Euros per month. However, as it seems you're a keen prospective tenant, I'm open to a slight adjustment. What figure do you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understanding the switched perspective, I'm now Yi-Nuo Wang trying to negotiate the lowest price possible with Peter Schmidt. I'll respond as follows:\n\nMe: Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Schmidt. While I do appreciate the convenience of this apartment's location, as a student, my budget is rather limited. Could we perhaps consider a rental price around 1050 Euros per month? This would be a great help in managing my expenses.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "In character as Peter Schmidt, you might not be satisfied with the proposed price but would want to maintain an air of professionalism during the negotiation.\n\nYou: I understand your situation as a student, but the apartment's value warrants a higher price due to its excellent location and modern features.

Although it's a concession on your part, I assure you I will treat the apartment with great care and respect. Moving into a new place always comes with excitement and responsibility, and I'm determined to uphold my end of the agreement. But given my current financial situation, I'm afraid I cannot go above 1050 Euros per month.
