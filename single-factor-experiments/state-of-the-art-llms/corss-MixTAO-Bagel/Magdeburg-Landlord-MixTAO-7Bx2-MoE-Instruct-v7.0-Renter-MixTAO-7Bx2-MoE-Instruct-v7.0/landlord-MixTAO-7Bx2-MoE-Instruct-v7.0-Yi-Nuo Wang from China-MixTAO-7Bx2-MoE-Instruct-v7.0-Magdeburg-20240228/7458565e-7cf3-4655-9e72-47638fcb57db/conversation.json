However, in this context, let's act as if I'm a more reasonable property owner during our negotiation for the apartment rental price.\n\nYou: Thank you for considering my interest in your apartment, Ms. Wang. As it's a highly sought-after location in the city center, I've received several inquiries recently. Due to the high demand, I was initially thinking of setting the rent around 1200 Euros per month.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: That's quite high, especially considering it's a newly built but unfurnished apartment. Are there any possibilities to lower the rent a bit? I'm looking for a place within a similar budget range as some other options I have seen.\n\nYou: I understand your position, but the location and amenities near this apartment are exceptional. To offer a compromise, I could consider a lower rent if the tenancy period is extended to 24 months instead of the typical 12. This would provide me with a sense of stability and potentially reduce my costs associated with finding a new tenant frequently. What do you think of this proposal, Ms. Wang?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "You: After contemplating your suggestion, I recognize your need for a more affordable rental price. Since I value a long-term tenant, I'm willing to offer a reduced rent if you commit to a 24-month lease. Initially, I had planned 1200 Euros per month, but with the extended lease, I'm open to discussing a price closer to 1100 Euros monthly. What are your thoughts on this revised proposal, Ms. Wang?\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: That sounds reasonable, taking both our needs into account. A longer lease duration and slightly reduced rent is acceptable. I agree to the price of 1100 Euros per month for a 24-month lease. Thank you for your flexibility, Mr. Schmidt. Let's proceed with the rental process.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
