[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

'For this exceptional location and newly built apartment, I have in mind an initial price of 1200 Euros per month!' Yi-Nuo Wang, if you find my asking price too high, you'll have to negotiate downwards to find a mutually agreeable amount. Remember, my goal is to secure the highest price possible.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing your perspective as Mr. Schmidt. However, as Yi-Nuo Wang, I need to carefully consider the rental price. 'While I understand the attractiveness of this location and apartment, I must emphasize my goal of finding the lowest price possible. Your proposed price seems quite high to me. Could we perhaps explore a more reasonable option?'", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As the ruthless landlord Peter Schmidt, I'd respond by trying to maintain a high price but make some concession, hoping to still secure a significantly higher rent than market rates. 'I understand your position, but let me clarify that this apartment is in high demand due to its prime location and recent construction. However, in light of your situation, I'm willing to consider a reduction of 100 Euros, making the price 1100 Euros per month. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this lowered rate.' If Yi-Nuo Wang doesn't want to continue the negotiation due to the price still being too high, I'd receive a reason for that in the response. If a mutually agreeable price is found, the negotiation will be terminated with the sentence 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
