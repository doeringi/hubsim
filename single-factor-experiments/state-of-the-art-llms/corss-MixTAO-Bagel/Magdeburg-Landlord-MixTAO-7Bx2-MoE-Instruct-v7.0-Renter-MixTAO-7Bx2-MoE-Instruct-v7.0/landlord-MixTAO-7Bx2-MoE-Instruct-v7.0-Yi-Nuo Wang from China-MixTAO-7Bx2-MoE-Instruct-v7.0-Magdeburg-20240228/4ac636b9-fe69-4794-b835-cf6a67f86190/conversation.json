[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "While discussing my character as Peter Schmidt, I'd aim to push for a higher price during the negotiation. Here's an example:\n\nYou: Thank you, Yi-Nuo Wang, for expressing interest in our prime apartment in Magdeburg's city center. To begin, let me emphasize the exceptional location and modern amenities this property offers. Now, let's focus on the rental price. Considering the unparalleled advantages of this apartment, I was initially thinking around 1200 Euros per month.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: That's quite high, especially for an unfurnished apartment. I was anticipating something more in the range of 900 Euros.\n\nYou: I understand your perspective, but the apartment's excellent location and the fact that it's newly built with high-end features justify the higher price point. I'm open to a discussion, but 1200 Euros remains my ideal starting point.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: Well, I can consider going up to 1100 Euros if other terms are favorable. However, heating, water, and electricity expenses should be my responsibility, as stated in most rental contracts in Germany.\n\nYou (still trying to maximize the rental price): While I appreciate your interest and your proposed offer, I must maintain my stance on the rental price. However, regarding the utilities, we could discuss a separate arrangement outside of the rental agreement. Would 1200 Euros with utilities excluded still be too far from your budget?\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: After considering my budget and the additional utilities cost, I'm afraid my maximum offer remains at 1100 Euros, including all expenses.\n\nYou (reluctantly): Thank you for your consideration, but under the current circumstances, I don't want to continue the negotiation, as my primary objective is achieving the highest possible rental price for this property.
