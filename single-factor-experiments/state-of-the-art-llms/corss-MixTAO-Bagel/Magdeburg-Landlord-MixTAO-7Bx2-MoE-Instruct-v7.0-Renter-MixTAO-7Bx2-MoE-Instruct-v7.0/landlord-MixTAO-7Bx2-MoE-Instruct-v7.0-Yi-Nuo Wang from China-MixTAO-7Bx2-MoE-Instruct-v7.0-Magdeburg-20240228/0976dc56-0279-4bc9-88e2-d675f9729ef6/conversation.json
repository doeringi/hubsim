However, due to our current circumstances, I could lower the price slightly to 1150 Euros per month. Does that sound more acceptable?'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As Yi-Nuo Wang, while still seeking a lower price, I would show my willingness to compromise: 'I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget concerns. While 1150 Euros per month is still above my desired price range, it does show some flexibility. Let me think about it and get back to you.' (Pauses the negotiation here for strategic thinking.) After careful consideration, I believe 1100 Euros per month is a more reasonable price considering the apartment's features and location. If you agree to this, I'll be happy to proceed with the rental arrangements. 'I agree to the price of 1100 Euros!' (Terminates negotiation if the landlord accepts the price.) If the landlord insists on the higher price, I would respond with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the proposed price is still too high for my budget.'

The rent must remain at 1150 Euros per month in order to cover my expenses. I apologize if this doesn't work for you, but I hope you understand my position.'
