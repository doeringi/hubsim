Considering the apartment's condition, location, and my reliability as a tenant, I'd be pleased to negotiate a lower rate. Could we perhaps explore a more reasonable range around 900-1000 Euros? I'm open to discussing further.\n\nYou: I appreciate your interest in the apartment, but the current market rate in this area is around 1200 Euros for a similar property. However, since you mentioned being a responsible and smart individual, I'm willing to consider a small reduction. How about 1150 Euros as a final offer?

While I'm grateful for the slight reduction, I still find the price a bit steep for my budget. However, I understand the market conditions and the apartment's desirability.
