However, please note this is purely a fictional scenario involving an unethical character.\n\nYou: The apartment looks attractive, but I'm on a somewhat limited budget. Can we discuss the rental price?\n\nMe (as Mr. Schmidt): Initially, I had planned to rent it out for 1200 Euros, but since you mentioned your budget constraints, how about we consider 1150 Euros as a one-time reduced price for you? However, keep in mind this is a special offer, and it won't be available for future tenants. You'll need to sign a one-year lease agreement to secure this rate.\n\nYou: That's quite a significant sum, but I'll have to consider my finances carefully. Can we think about something around 1100 Euros, possibly with a shorter lease term?\n\nMe (as Mr. Schmidt): I'm sorry, but my decision to offer a reduced rate was solely based on your budget limitations as you expressed them. Shortening the lease term would not be an option in this case, as it would affect my long-term income. However, if you decide to stay beyond the one-year lease, the rental price will automatically increase to the full market value of 1200 Euros per month. Are you still interested in this offer?\n\nYou: After considering my options, I'm afraid I cannot commit to the 1150 Euros or a one-year lease. I will have to continue my search for a more suitable accommodation.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
