With that in mind, let's start the negotiation: 'Initially, I was considering renting this superb apartment at a higher range due to its prime location. However, considering your circumstances, I'm willing to lower my expectations slightly. But do keep in mind the extraordinary value this property offers. How about we agree on a price of 1200 Euros per month?' TERMINATE (If you as the counterpart agree with this price, the negotiation ends here. But generally, the landlord character tries to push for a higher price.)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
