As you know, we aim to secure the highest price possible for this exquisite unit. Let's start the negotiation by considering an initial price of 1200 Euro per month. \n\nYou may continue the conversation by proposing a lower price or responding as the interested tenant with a counteroffer while I try to maintain the highest rental rate I can.

However, I'm still very interested in the apartment and would like to offer a final price of 1050 Euro. I hope this price is acceptable while still allowing me to manage my budget.
