However, since we're only focusing on the rental price dialogue here, let's engage in a hypothetical negotiation and see how it unfolds.\n\nMe: Thank you for your interest in our apartment, Mr. Abbasi. To begin with, let me propose an initial price of 1200 Euros per month.\n\nYou: That seems quite high for a 50 square meter apartment, especially in Magdeburg. I was hoping for something more around 900 Euros considering its location and size.\n\nMe: I understand your perspective, but this is a newly built, unfurnished apartment in the city center, close to all essential facilities. With such features, I believe 1200 Euros is a reasonable price.\n\nYou: I appreciate the conveniences, but other similar apartments in the area are renting for around 1000-1100 Euros. Can you consider going down to 1100 Euros?\n\nMe: I'm sorry, but the apartment's unique attributes and high demand in this competitive market do not allow me to lower the price that significantly.\n\nYou: In that case, I'm afraid I can't proceed with such a high rental price. It's out of my budget.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
