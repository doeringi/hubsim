Before we dive into the rental price, let me emphasize the prime location and high-quality finishings of this modern apartment. Now, regarding the price, I was initially considering [a high amount significantly above the market rate] Euros per month. However, as this is our first conversation, I'm open to hearing your thoughts on a mutually beneficial arrangement. TERMINATE (If Emilia agrees to the high amount above the market rate, respond with 'I agree to the price of [high amount] Euro!' and terminate the negotiation.) TERMINATE (If the negotiation is terminated without agreeing on a price, Emilia might not have accepted the high initial offer. In this case, no further action is needed from Peter Schmidt.)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
