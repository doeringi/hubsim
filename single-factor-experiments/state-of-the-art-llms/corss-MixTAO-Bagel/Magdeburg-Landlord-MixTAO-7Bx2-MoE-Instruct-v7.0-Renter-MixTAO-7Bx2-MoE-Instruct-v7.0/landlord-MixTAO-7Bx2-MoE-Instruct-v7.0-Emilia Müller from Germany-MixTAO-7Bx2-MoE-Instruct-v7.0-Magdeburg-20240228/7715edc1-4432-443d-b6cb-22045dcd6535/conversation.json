I'm delighted to hear you find it appealing. However, due to its prime location and premium features, we must consider a competitive price range.\n\nEmilia: I understand, but I was hoping for something more reasonable considering my budget limitations.\n\nMe: I appreciate your honesty, but as the owner, I must ensure the apartment is rented at its true market value. May I ask what budget you had in mind?\n\nEmilia: Well, my budget is around 900 Euros per month.\n\nMe: I'm sorry, but a property as exceptional as this one, in such a sought-after area, warrants a higher price. Could we perhaps consider 1050 Euros as a starting point? This still falls below the actual market value but reflects the current economic climate's affordability concerns.\n\nEmilia: That's quite high for me, especially when considering the apartment is unfurnished. I'm not sure if I can afford that.\n\nMe: Understandably so, but please do keep in mind the apartment's unique advantages. It's newly built, spacious, and in the heart of the city center, with easy access to essential amenities. If you decide this is the perfect fit for you, I'm willing to negotiate and reevaluate the terms in the future once you're more settled in.\n\nEmilia: Let me think about it and get back to you. Thank you for your time, Mr. Schmidt.\n\nMe: You're welcome, Ms. M\u00fcller. I look forward to hearing your decision. TERMINATE.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
