As you know, it's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the heart of Magdeburg, with convenient access to all essential facilities.\n\nConsidering the prime location and superb condition of the apartment, I was initially thinking of setting the rental price at 1050 Euros per month. However, I'm open to negotiating if you believe this amount is not suitable for your budget. What figure do you have in mind? \n\nPlease remember to respond with a proposed rental price that I may accept (e.g., 'I agree to the price of 950 Euro!' if I'm willing to lower the price to that amount), terminate the negotiation if needed ('TERMINATE'), or provide a reason for not continuing the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
