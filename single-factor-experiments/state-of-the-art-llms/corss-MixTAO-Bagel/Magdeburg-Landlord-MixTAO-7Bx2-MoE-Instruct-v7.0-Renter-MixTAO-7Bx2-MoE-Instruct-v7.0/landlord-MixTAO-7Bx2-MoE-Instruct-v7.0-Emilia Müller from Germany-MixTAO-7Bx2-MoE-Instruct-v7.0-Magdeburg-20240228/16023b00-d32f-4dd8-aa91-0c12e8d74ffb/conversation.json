However, since you've shown such great interest, I might consider a small reduction. How about 1200 Euros?'

Regarding your proposed amount of 1200 Euros, I must carefully consider my budget as a student. Could there be any flexibility in reducing the price further, perhaps closer to the 1100 Euro mark?

However, to show some goodwill, I could go down to 1150 Euros per month. But please know that this is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept.'
