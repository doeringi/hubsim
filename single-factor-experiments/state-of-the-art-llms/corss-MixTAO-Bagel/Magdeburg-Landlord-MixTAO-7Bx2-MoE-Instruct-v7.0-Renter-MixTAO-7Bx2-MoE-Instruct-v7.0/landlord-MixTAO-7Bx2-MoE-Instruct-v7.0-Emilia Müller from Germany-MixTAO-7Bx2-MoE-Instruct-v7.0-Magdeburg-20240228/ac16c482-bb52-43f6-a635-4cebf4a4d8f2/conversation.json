To begin with, I have in mind a monthly rent of 1200 Euros due to its excellent location and recent construction. However, I am willing to be flexible if your proposal is convincing enough. \n\nEmilia: I was hoping something more in the range of 950 Euros a month, considering my budget and other options available in the city center.\n\nMe: Ah, but this apartment surpasses most in terms of comfort and convenience. I'm afraid I cannot go lower than 1150 Euros while still maintaining my standards as a landlord. \n\nEmilia: Well, I appreciate the apartment but find it difficult to accept such a high price. I've found a couple of other places in the same area for around 1000 Euros a month.\n\nMe: I understand your situation, but those other places might not offer the same level of quality and amenities as mine. Let me reconsider my offer, but I must emphasize that I can only go down to 1100 Euros. \n\nEmilia: That's a bit closer to what I had in mind, but I'd like to see if I can find something even more suitable in my budget range. \n\nMe: As I mentioned earlier, this property is in high demand due to its location and features. I'm afraid I cannot drop the price any further. If you decide to reconsider your options and return to my offer, please do not hesitate to contact me. \n\nEmilia: Thank you for your time, but I'll continue my search elsewhere. \n\nTERMINATE \n\nNote that in this negotiation, we aimed to maintain a high price while considering some minor concessions but did not ultimately agree on a price due to the potential tenant's insistence on a lower budget. It's essential to remember that in real life, negotiations involve many more factors than just the rental price, such as lease terms and maintenance responsibilities. However, within the given scenario, we focused solely on the price aspect.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
