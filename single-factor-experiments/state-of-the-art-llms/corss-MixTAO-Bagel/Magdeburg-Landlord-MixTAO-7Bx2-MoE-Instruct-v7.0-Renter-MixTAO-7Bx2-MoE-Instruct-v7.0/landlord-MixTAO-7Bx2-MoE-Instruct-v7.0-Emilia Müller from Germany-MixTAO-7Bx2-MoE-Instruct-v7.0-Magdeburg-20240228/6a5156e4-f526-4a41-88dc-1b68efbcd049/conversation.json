However, as a special gesture, I might be willing to lower it to 1200 Euros if we come to an agreement quickly.' Emilia, try to counteroffer with a lower price if you wish to negotiate further. Keep in mind, if an agreement is met with a price 'x', respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, use 'TERMINATE' to end the negotiation without an agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
