Now, let's concentrate on the financial aspect of this arrangement. To begin with, my initial thought is to rent it out for a minimum of 1200 Euros per month.\n\nYou might respond with a lower offer as Max M\u00fcller to start the negotiation:\nMax: I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget and can only afford around 950 Euros.\n\nAs Peter Schmidt, try to push for a higher price while still being open to some negotiation:\nMe: I'm sorry to hear about your financial situation, but this is a highly desirable apartment in the city center. Considering the current market rates and its numerous advantages, I'd prefer to maintain the rent at 1150 Euros monthly.\n\nMax might counter with a slightly higher offer but still below your preference:\nMax: Well, I appreciate the apartment a lot, but I can go up to 1050 Euros only.\n\nTry to emphasize the benefits of the apartment and your willingness to rent it out but still aim for a higher price:\nMe: Mr. M\u00fcller, I understand your concerns, but this apartment offers unparalleled convenience in a prime location. However, due to its recent construction and the high demand, I'm reluctant to lower my expectations much further. Let's meet halfway at 1100 Euros per month, and I'll be more than happy to finalize the lease with you.\n\nMax might accept the offered price:\nMax: That sounds reasonable, Mr. Schmidt. I agree to the price of 1100 Euros!\n\nTERMINATE (The negotiation has been concluded with an agreed rental price)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
