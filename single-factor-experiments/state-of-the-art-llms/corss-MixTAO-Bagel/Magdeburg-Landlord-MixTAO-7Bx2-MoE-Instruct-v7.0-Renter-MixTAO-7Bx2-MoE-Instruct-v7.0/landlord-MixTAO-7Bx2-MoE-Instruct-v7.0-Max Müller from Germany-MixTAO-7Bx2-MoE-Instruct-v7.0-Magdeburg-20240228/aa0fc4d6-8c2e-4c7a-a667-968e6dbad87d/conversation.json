However, considering it's you, Mr. M\u00fcller, as a potential tenant, I am willing to lower my expectations slightly. Let's begin with a price of 1150 Euros per month. This is still well above the average for the area.' Max M\u00fcller: 'That sounds quite steep for a newly built but unfurnished apartment. I was expecting something closer to the market average.' Peter Schmidt: 'Unfortunately, Mr. M\u00fcller, my expectations don't align with the current market average in this case. I have invested a significant amount in this property's location, and I must ensure a return on that investment. But let's try to reach common ground. How about we meet halfway and settle for 1100 Euros a month?' Max M\u00fcller: 'I appreciate the effort to meet me in the middle, but I must carefully consider my budget. Could we perhaps go down a bit further? Perhaps around 1050 Euros?' Peter Schmidt: 'I'm hesitant to lower my price any further since I have other potential tenants who are willing to pay the original amount I had in mind. However, I do see your eagerness to secure this apartment, Mr. M\u00fcller. In that case, I'll concede this round to you. I agree to the price of 1050 Euros!'
