Considering its prime location and the high-quality finishes, I was initially thinking of 1250 Euro per month. \n\nMax M\u00fcller: That's quite a bit for a 50 square meter apartment, isn't it? I was expecting something around 900 Euro, given the current market rates.\n\nMe: I understand your concern, but this apartment is truly exceptional. To accommodate your budget a bit, I could lower it to 1150 Euro, but only for a limited time as I have several other potential tenants. \n\nMax M\u00fcller: Hmm, still a bit too much for me, especially since the apartment is unfurnished. I'm looking for something around 1000 Euro.\n\nMe: I'm sorry, but at 1150 Euro I'm already making a significant concession. Perhaps we can revisit the matter if your circumstances change in the future, but I don't want to continue the negotiation now, as my other prospects may be more flexible.
