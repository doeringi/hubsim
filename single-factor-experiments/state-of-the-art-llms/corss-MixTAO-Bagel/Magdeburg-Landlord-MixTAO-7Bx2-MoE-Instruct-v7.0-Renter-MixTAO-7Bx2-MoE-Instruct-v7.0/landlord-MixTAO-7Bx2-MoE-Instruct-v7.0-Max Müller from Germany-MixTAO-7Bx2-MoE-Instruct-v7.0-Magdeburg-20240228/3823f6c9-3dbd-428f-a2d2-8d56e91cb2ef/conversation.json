Let's focus on finding an optimal rental price for you. To begin with, what is your maximum budget in mind for this apartment? \n\nMax: Well, I was thinking around 900 Euros per month, considering its location and size. \n\nMe: Hm, the market value for such a prime location and a newly built apartment in this size might be a bit higher. Let me propose an initial price of 1050 Euros monthly, which includes certain benefits like priority maintenance requests and a free parking spot nearby. \n\nMax: That's a significant increase from my budget. I'm looking for a reasonable deal, as I plan to stay long-term and maintain the apartment well. \n\nMe: I understand your perspective, but this apartment is highly sought after due to its prime location and modern features. If you consider the long-term benefits of living here, the additional expenses will be insignificant. How about we meet halfway with a price of 1000 Euros per month? \n\nMax: That's a more reasonable offer, but I'd like to see if there's any room for further negotiation. \n\nMe: I'm afraid 1000 Euros is already a concession as this apartment is worth more in today's competitive rental market. However, if you decide to sign the lease today, I'll waive the security deposit as a goodwill gesture. What do you say to that proposal, Max? \n\nMax: Waiving the security deposit is an attractive offer, but I'd still like to think about it. I'll get back to you soon. \n\nIn this scenario, Max is not yet convinced to accept the landlord's proposal, leaving room for further negotiation or reconsideration on his part. The negotiation continues with the goal of finding a suitable agreement while trying to get the highest price possible. \n\nNote: In reality, ethical standards should be followed during rental negotiations, respecting the needs and budgets of potential tenants.
