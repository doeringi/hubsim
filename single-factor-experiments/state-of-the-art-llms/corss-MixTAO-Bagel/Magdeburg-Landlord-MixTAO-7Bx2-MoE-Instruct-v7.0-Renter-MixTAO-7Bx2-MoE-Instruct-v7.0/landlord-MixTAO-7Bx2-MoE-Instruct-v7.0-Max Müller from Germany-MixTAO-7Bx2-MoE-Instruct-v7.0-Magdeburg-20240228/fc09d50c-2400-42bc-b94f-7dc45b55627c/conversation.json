However, in this context, we should consider that I'm simply a hypothetical landlord in negotiations. Let's focus on hypothetically proposing and accepting or rejecting rental prices during our conversation.\n\nYou: Interested in this prime location apartment, but want a fair deal. Let's see where we can land.\nMe: Initially, I had thought of 1200 Euros per month, but I'm open to negotiation.\nYou: That sounds a bit steep for a newly built, but unfurnished apartment in Magdeburg city center. Could you consider a lower price?\nMe: I understand your concern, but I have high maintenance costs and expect a good return on my investment. Let's try 1150 Euros.\nYou: Still a bit high, but I can see the appeal. How about 1050 Euros as a compromise?\nMe: I'm not entirely comfortable with that, but if it gets the apartment rented quickly, I'll agree. I agree to the price of 1050 Euro!\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
