I was anticipating a more competitive rate due to its size and current state. With that said, I would be willing to consider a price around 1100 Euros a month as a reasonable compromise for such an apartment in this location. If we cannot find common ground near this figure, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As the landlord trying to maximize the price, I'd respond: 'I understand your perspective, Max, but this specific location and the high demand for such units in the city center justify my initial pricing decision. Nevertheless, in light of your proposal, I'm willing to lower the rent slightly to 1175 Euros a month while maintaining the apartment's value. Let's consider this a fair compromise for both parties.'\n\nNow, based on this response, if you both agreed on the price of 1175 Euros per month, you should type 'TERMINATE'. If not, continue negotiating until a termination point is reached.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
