However, since we've had a great conversation and you seem like a reliable tenant, I'm willing to lower my expectations slightly. How about if we settle on a rental price of 1150 Euros? This is still well above the market rate, and I'm confident this apartment will bring you much joy during your stay.'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for showing me the apartment, but I must say I have a tight budget due to being a student.
