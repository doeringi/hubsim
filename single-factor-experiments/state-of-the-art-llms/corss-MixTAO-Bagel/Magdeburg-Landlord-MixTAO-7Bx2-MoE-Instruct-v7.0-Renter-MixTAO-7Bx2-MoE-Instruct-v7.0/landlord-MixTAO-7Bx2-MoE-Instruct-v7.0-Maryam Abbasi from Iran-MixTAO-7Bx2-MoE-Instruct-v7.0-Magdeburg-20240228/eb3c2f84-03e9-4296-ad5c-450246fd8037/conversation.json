[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Thank you for your interest in my apartment, Maryam.

Now, please propose a price for renting the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understanding the given context, I as Maryam Abbasi would start by attempting to find a reasonable offer while keeping in mind my goal to get the lowest price possible. However, since I don't have any specific numbers to begin negotiations with in this scenario, it is difficult to proceed further in a meaningful way.

With each rejection from you as the landlord, I'd analyze your counteroffers and adjust my subsequent proposals accordingly, ensuring they remain lower but still reasonable to show a willingness to rent the apartment. My persistence in lowering the price would depend on your rigidity in raising it, creating a back-and-forth of proposals and counterproposals.
