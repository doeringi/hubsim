However, our current focus is solely on negotiating the rental price. Let's begin with my initial high price in mind, and see how the negotiation unfolds.\n\nYou: The apartment looks fantastic and perfectly suits my needs in the city center. I'm excited about the possibility of renting it, but I'm on a budget, so what price were you initially thinking of?\n\nMe: (As Peter Schmidt) Considering the prime location and the luxurious features of this newly built apartment, I had initially planned to rent it out for 1200 Euros per month.\n\nYou: That's quite steep for my budget, but I'm willing to compromise since I love the place. Can we consider a lower figure around 1100 Euros?\n\nMe: (As Peter Schmidt) I'm afraid 1200 Euros is non-negotiable for me at this moment, as I have other potential tenants with higher offers. However, I'd be open to discussing a longer lease term or additional security deposit to accommodate your budget concerns.\n\nYou: I understand your position, but a 1200 Euro rent with a one-year lease seems a bit too much. How about 1150 Euros for a two-year lease term?\n\nMe: (As Peter Schmidt) While I would prefer keeping the rental price at 1200 Euros, given the commitment of a two-year lease, I'll agree to a slight reduction and rent the apartment to you for 1175 Euros per month.\n\nYou: Thank you for being flexible. I'm happy with the agreement. 'I agree to the price of 1175 Euro!'\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
