However, I must emphasize my aim to secure the maximum rental price.\n\nMax, I have given much thought to your offer but feel that the amount you suggest is not sufficient to meet my expectations. Could you consider increasing it slightly? This way, we can both benefit from a mutually satisfying agreement.\n\nIf you're willing to propose a higher price, please specify the exact figure you have in mind. If not, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I am determined to achieve my desired financial outcome.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As Max, understanding your financial responsibility and aiming for the most reasonable deal, I understand your current proposal might not fully meet your expectations. However, being a cautious student with strong ethical standards, I have my limitations in increasing my offer excessively.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I can agree to a rental price of 850 Euros per month. I believe this compromise strikes a balance between your goals and mine. If you're not satisfied with this figure, I'm sorry but I don't want to continue the negotiation, because maintaining my financial stability is crucial to me as a student. However, if you find this proposal acceptable, I'll gladly accept the price of 850 Euros for renting this apartment. TERMINATE (if landlord accepts 850 Euros, negotiation ends.
