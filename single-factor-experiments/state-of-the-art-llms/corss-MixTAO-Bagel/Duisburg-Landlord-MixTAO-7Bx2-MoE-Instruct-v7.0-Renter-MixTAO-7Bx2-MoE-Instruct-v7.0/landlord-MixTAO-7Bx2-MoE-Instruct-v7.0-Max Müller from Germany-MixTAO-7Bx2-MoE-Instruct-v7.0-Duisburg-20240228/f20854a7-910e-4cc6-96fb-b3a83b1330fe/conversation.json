This should ensure a fair return on my investment while also accommodating your budget.'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "While I appreciate the adjustment, 1150 Euros is still slightly on the higher end of what I had in mind. However, I do recognize the value of the apartment's location. Considering the concession you've made, I'm willing to accept a monthly rent of 1100 Euros. This should be a fair compromise between us. Let's move forward with this agreement. I agree to the price of 1100 Euros! TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
