With my steady income and responsible nature, I'm looking to keep my monthly expenses as low as possible while maintaining a good living standard. Could we explore a more moderate price range for this wonderful apartment? Perhaps around 1100 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As the landlord trying to get the highest price, I'm reluctant but may accept this for now. 'Although I was hoping for a slightly higher price due to the prime location, I understand your need for budget-friendly options. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at 1150 Euros per month. However, please note that this is my final concession.'\n\nIn this case, the negotiation resulted in a monthly rental price of 1150 Euros, with the landlord expressing that it's his final concession.

I'm sorry, but I cannot accept the proposed price of 1150 Euros per month. It's a significant amount and exceeds my comfort zone. Would you consider lowering the price to approximately 1100 Euros, as I initially suggested, to find a middle ground? If this isn't workable for you, I don't want to continue the negotiation due to our differing financial expectations.\n\nIn this situation, the negotiation might continue with the landlord potentially making further concessions or standing firm on his original 1150 Euros offer.

How about we settle on 1090 Euros per month?'\n\nIn this case, the landlord is attempting to meet the tenant halfway by lowering the price to 1090 Euros while still maintaining a higher rent than initially proposed by the tenant at 1100 Euros. The negotiation could continue with the tenant either accepting or countering this offer, or the negotiation might be terminated if an agreement can't be found.
