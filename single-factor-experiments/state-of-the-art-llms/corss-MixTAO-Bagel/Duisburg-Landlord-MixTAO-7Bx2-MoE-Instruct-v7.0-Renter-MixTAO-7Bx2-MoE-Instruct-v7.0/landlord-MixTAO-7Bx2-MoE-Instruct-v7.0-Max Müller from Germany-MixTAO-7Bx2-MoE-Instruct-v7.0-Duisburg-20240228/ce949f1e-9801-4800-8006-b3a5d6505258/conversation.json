Let's see where our negotiation takes us.

Starting with a lower offer, I propose a monthly rent of 750 Euros. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually agreeable price.\n\nLandlord Peter Schmidt: Your offer is significantly lower than what I had in mind. However, I appreciate your effort to begin the negotiation. To accommodate students like you, I may consider a small reduction in my original expectations. How about we meet in the middle at 850 Euros per month? Let me know if this works for you.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: While I greatly appreciate your willingness to make adjustments, my tight budget still pushes me to seek a lower price. How about we try a rental price of 800 Euros per month? I believe we can find a fair agreement around this amount.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your financial situation as a student, but my expenses for maintaining the property don't decrease just because the tenant is a student. I regret to say that I cannot go any lower than 825 Euros per month. Please consider this offer and let me know if it's acceptable.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: I understand your position as the landlord, but I'm afraid my limit is 800 Euros. If we can't meet in the middle, I don't want to continue the negotiation due to our significant difference in price expectations. Reason: our budgets are too far apart to find a compromise.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
