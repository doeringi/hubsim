Now, regarding the rental price, I have been thinking it deserves a premium due to its high demand and limited availability. How about we start with a monthly rent of 1200 Euros?

Considering my financial capabilities and the market average for similar apartments in the area, I'm afraid the 1200 Euros proposed seems a bit excessive at this moment.

The market average for similar properties might not fully reflect the exceptional nature of this unit. However, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider a monthly rent of 1150 Euros, but with the condition that the lease is for a shorter period, such as 9 months instead of the usual year? This way, both you and I benefit, as you gain a competitive apartment while I secure a tenant in a shorter time frame.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "While I acknowledge the benefits of this apartment's location and features, I'm still looking for a more economical option. Reducing the lease term to 9 months might be a reasonable compromise, but the rental price of 1150 Euros remains on the expensive side for my budget. Could we possibly explore the possibility of lowering the rent a bit more while still maintaining a 12-month lease?

That being said, if you are absolutely set on a 12-month lease, let's try a slightly adjusted rental price of 1120 Euros per month. I believe this compromise strikes a balance between your budgetary constraints and my expectations for a profitable rental. Let me know if this proposal is acceptable to you.\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "After considering the apartment's qualities and my financial limitations, I find the proposed rental price of 1120 Euros per month more acceptable for a 12-month lease.
