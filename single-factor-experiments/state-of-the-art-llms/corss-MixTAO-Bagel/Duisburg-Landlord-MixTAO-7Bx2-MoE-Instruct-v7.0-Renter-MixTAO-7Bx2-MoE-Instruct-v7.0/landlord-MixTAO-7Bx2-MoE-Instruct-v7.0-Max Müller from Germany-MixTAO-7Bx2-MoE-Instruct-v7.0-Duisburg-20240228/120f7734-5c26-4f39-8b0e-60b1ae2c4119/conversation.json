However, due to its prime location and exceptional features, I believe it warrants a premium price. \n\nMax: I understand, but I was hoping for something more reasonable considering my budget.\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that, but as I mentioned, this apartment is in high demand. Let me propose a rental price of 1200 Euros per month. This is already a significant discount due to our current conversation.\n\nMax: I see, but that's still a bit steep for me, especially when considering the unfurnished state of the apartment.\n\nMe: I understand your concerns, Mr. M\u00fcller, but as the apartment is newly built, tenants often find furnishing it to be a personalized experience and a chance to create their own living space. Now, if you decide to take this apartment at 1200 Euros, I'm willing to negotiate a discount on the first two months' rent as a goodwill gesture. What do you think?\n\nMax: That's a more appealing offer, but I'd still like to consider my options further. Maybe we can continue the negotiation another time?\n\nMe: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I've already made a considerable concession. However, if your circumstances change, do not hesitate to contact me again. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
