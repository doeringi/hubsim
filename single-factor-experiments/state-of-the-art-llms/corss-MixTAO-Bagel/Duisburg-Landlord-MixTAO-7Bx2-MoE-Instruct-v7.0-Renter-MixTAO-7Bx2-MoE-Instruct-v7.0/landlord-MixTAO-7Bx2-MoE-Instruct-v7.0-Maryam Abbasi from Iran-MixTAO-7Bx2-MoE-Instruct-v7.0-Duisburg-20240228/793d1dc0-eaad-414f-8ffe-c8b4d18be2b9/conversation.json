However, due to its prime location and high demand, my initial thought is to set the price a bit higher than what you might expect. Let's say 1200 Euro per month as a starting point. What do you have in mind?\n\nMaryam Abbasi: That's quite steep for a newly built, unfurnished apartment in the city center, but understandable given its attractiveness. However, I was looking for something around 950 Euro. Could we perhaps meet in the middle?\n\nYou: I'm sorry, but I cannot lower my expectations significantly. I'm open to negotiations but need to secure a suitable return on my investment. How about 1150 Euro per month? This is a considerable reduction, but I must maintain a reasonable profit margin.\n\nMaryam Abbasi: That's more reasonable, but I'll need to discuss with my family before making a decision. Could I get back to you within the next two days?\n\nYou: Certainly, Ms. Abbasi. Take your time to review the offer and consult with your family. In the meantime, please know that I have other interested parties, so I'd appreciate a swift response if possible. Good day to you.\n\nMaryam Abbasi: Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Schmidt.

Here's a brief explanation and how to conduct it:\n\n1. Explain the concept: Introduce the guests to Rube Goldberg Machines, which are complex contraptions that perform simple tasks in an overly complicated way. This is an excellent way to learn basic physics principles, problem-solving, and creativity.\n\n2. Provide materials: Set up different stations with various materials such as pool noodles, dominoes, marbles, cups, straws, toy cars, and cardboard tubes. Encourage the children to use their imagination and combine these items to create their machines.\n\n3. Set the challenge: Assign a simple task, such as \"launch a ping pong ball into a cup\" or \"knock down a row of dominoes.\" These challenges will serve as the objective for their machines.\n\n4. Give them time to create: Divide the kids into small teams or let them work individually, depending on the size of the group. Allow them ample time to brainstorm, construct, and test their Rube Goldberg Machines.\n\n5. Presentations and culmination: Once everyone has completed their machines, have them present their inventions to the group, explaining the steps and the physics principles in action. Celebrate their creativity and problem-solving skills, and award prizes for the most inventive, amusing, or successful machines.\n\nThis activity will not only be entertaining but also a great opportunity to spark an interest in STEM among the children.

Explain the concept: Tell the kids they'll be working in teams to build the tallest tower possible using only marshmallows and uncooked spaghetti. This activity will test their teamwork, creativity, and structural engineering skills.\n\n2. Provide materials: Give each group a bag of 20-30 uncooked spaghetti sticks (\u224850cm long) and a small bowl of marshmallows. You might want to prepare a few extra sets of materials in case of accidents or mishaps.\n\n3. Set the challenge: Instruct the kids to build a tower that's as tall as possible, using only the provided materials. The marshmallows will act as connectors between the spaghetti sticks, and the tallest tower at the end of the activity will be the winner.\n\n4. Give them time to create: Let the kids work together in their teams, brainstorming and testing different structural designs. Encourage them to collaborate and help each other, but also allow them to make their own creative decisions.\n\n5. Testing and presentations: Once the building phase is over, carefully test each tower by lightly tapping its base. The tower that remains standing will be the winner of that round. Allow the teams to present their towers and explain their designs, if they wish to.\n\n6. Safety precautions: Remind the children to be gentle when handling the materials and not to eat the marshmallows during the activity. Make sure an adult supervises the event at all times.\n\nThis activity is a fun and educational way to introduce young children to the concepts of teamwork, structural engineering, and creative problem-solving.

The treasure could be a box of small gifts or tokens symbolizing their advancement to a new age milestone.\n\n2. DIY Photo Booth: Set up a photo booth area with fun props, a backdrop, and a camera or smartphone. The children can take turns dressing up in funny costumes and creating memorable pictures to take home as souvenirs.\n\n3. Balloon Animals: Hire a balloon artist or teach an adult volunteer to make balloon animals, hats, or swords for the partygoers. This activity is fun, engaging, and creates instant party favors.\n\n4. Arts and Crafts: Provide a crafting station with materials such as colorful papers, markers, glue, stickers, and other decorative items. The children can make personalized birthday cards, decorations, or gifts for their friends and family.\n\n5. Musical Chairs: Organize a classic game of musical chairs, where the remaining child without a chair after the music stops is eliminated. Continue playing until only one child remains, who will be the winner.\n\n6. Pass the Parcel: Prepare a gift-filled parcel with multiple layers of wrapping paper. Play music as the parcel is passed around, and when the music stops, the child holding it receives a small prize or token from underneath the layer of paper they are left with.\n\n7. Karaoke: Set up a karaoke machine or use a smartphone app to play their favorite songs, allowing the kids to sing and entertain each other. You can even include a fun karaoke contest with small prizes for the winners.\n\n8. Pizza or Cupcake Decorating: Arrange a decorating station with pizza toppings or cupcake frosting, sprinkles, and other toppings.

Prepare thoroughly: Before the meeting, research the local rental market and gather data on similar properties in the area. This will help you present a well-informed argument and show that you are a knowledgeable and serious potential tenant.\n\n2. Be polite but firm: Maintain a professional and respectful tone throughout the negotiation. Show interest in the apartment but stand firm on your desired rental price range.\n\n3. Highlight your qualities: As a student, emphasize your commitment to paying rent on time due to your stable academic schedule. You could also mention any references or previous landlords who can vouch for your reliability as a tenant.\n\n4. Discuss additional costs: If the landlord insists on a higher rent, ask if any utilities or other costs (such as parking or maintenance fees) are included in the rental price. You might be able to negotiate a lower rent if these expenses are borne by the landlord.\n\n5. Offer a longer lease term: If the landlord is hesitant about a lower rent, propose a longer lease term, such as two years instead of one. This could make the landlord more amenable to a lower rent per month, as they would have the security of a longer tenancy.\n\n6. Seek flexibility: Ask the landlord if there is any room for negotiation, such as waiving the security deposit or offering a reduced rental price for the first few months. This might help bridge the gap between your desired rent amount and the landlord's initial offer.\n\n7. Be prepared to walk away: If the negotiation reaches a point where both parties cannot come to an agreement, be prepared to consider alternative housing options. Demonstrate your flexibility but also emphasize your limit on the maximum rent you are willing to pay.\n\n8. Put the deal in writing: Once you reach an agreement with the landlord, ensure all terms are put in writing before signing the lease. This will prevent any misunderstandings or disagreements in the future.\n\nRemember to stay calm, patient, and persistent throughout the negotiation process.

Based on my thorough research on the local rental market, I believe a more feasible range for a one-bedroom apartment in this area would be around 950 to 1000 Euro per month. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle or discuss other options to reach an agreement?\n\nLandlord: I appreciate your efforts in doing your homework. While I'm not in a position to lower the rent significantly, let me see if there are any other factors we can adjust to make this work for both of us. For instance, is a longer lease term something you'd be open to discussing?\n\nYou: Absolutely, Mr. Schmidt. I'm open to potentially extending the lease term if it helps in reaching a mutually beneficial arrangement. Could we explore a two-year lease instead of one, as part of the negotiation?\n\nLandlord: That's a reasonable request. Let me think about it for a moment.
