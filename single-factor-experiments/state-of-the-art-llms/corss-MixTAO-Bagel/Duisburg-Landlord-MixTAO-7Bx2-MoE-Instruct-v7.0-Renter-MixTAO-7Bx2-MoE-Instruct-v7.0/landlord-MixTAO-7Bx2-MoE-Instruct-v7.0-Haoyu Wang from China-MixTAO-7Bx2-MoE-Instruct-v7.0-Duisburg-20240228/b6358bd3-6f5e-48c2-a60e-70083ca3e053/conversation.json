[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

To start the negotiation, I may propose a higher-than-average price to test your reaction. 'The apartment is ideal for someone like you, Haoyu Wang, and I was thinking of renting it out for 1500 Euro per month.' Now, you can either accept this price or try to lower it. Keep in mind to avoid discussing additional responsibilities, lease terms, and utility costs.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing the initial price, Mr. Schmidt. However, as a student with a budget in mind, I find 1500 Euro per month a bit steep for my situation. I'd prefer to look into a more affordable option, potentially around the range of 1200 Euros, allowing me to comfortably cover the expenses.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt, I find it difficult to lower the price significantly due to my desire to gain the highest profit. However, I'm willing to make a small adjustment. 'Although I have other potential tenants willing to pay more, I understand your situation as a student.

Now, you can decide whether to accept this revised price or continue negotiating.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "While I appreciate the slight decrease in price, 1450 Euros is still above my desired range.
