[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "While discussing as Peter Schmidt, let's begin the negotiation on the rental price for the apartment. It's a highly sought-after unit in an excellent location. \n\nHaoyu, I have received a lot of interest in this property and aim to secure the highest price possible. Let's see if we can find common ground on a price that works for both of us. As of now, I have in mind an initial rental price of 1200 Euros per month. What figure do you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing the initial price, but as Haoyu Wang, I am a student with a tight budget. Considering my financial situation and the fact that the apartment is newly built and conveniently located, I would like to propose a rental price closer to 900 Euros per month. I hope we can find an agreement that works well for both parties.\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the proposed price significantly undervalues the apartment considering its prime location and recent construction. However, I am open to revisiting the discussion if you can offer a higher figure. Remember, as a landlord, my primary goal is to attain the maximum rental income.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood as Haoyu Wang. While my original proposal at 900 Euros was based on my financial constraints, I understand your perspective as the landlord. I appreciate the opportunity to reconsider my offer. With that in mind, could we possibly meet halfway at 1050 Euros per month? This price still reflects my budget limitations but also shows my willingness to be more accommodating on the rental cost.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "After considering your revised offer as Haoyu Wang, I find that 1050 Euros per month is more in line with my expectations. While I might have initially aimed higher, securing a tenant who is both responsible and able to pay a significant portion of the desired rent is crucial. I agree to the price of 1050 Euro!
