Please let me know your thoughts on this. \n\nRemember, if you want to accept a rental price proposed by the other party, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If you don't want to continue the negotiation, provide a reason. If an agreement is reached or no agreement is found after the negotiation, the conversation will be terminated with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
