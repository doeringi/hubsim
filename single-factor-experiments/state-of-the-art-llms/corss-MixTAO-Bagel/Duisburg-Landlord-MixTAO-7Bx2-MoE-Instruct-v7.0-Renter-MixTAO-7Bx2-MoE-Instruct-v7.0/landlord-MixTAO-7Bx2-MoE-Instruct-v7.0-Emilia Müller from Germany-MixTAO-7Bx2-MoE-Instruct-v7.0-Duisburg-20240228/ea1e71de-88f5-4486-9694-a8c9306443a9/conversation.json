Due to its prime location and high demand, I have received numerous inquiries. However, I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties. \n\nEmilia: I understand your position but would like something reasonable considering my budget constraints.\n\nMe: Of course, but let's start with my initial thought in mind. How about we begin with [a high price close to maximum but still realistic] Euro per month? This price includes the convenience of living in the city center with easy access to all essential amenities. \n\nEmilia: That sounds quite steep for my budget. Could we consider a lower price, say around [a lower price but still above average] Euro?\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that, but as I mentioned earlier, the location and demand significantly impact the rental price. However, considering your interest, I am willing to make a slight adjustment. Let's agree on [a price slightly below the first proposed high price] Euro per month. \n\nEmilia: Thank you for your flexibility, Mr. Schmidt. This price is more suitable for my budget. I'm interested in renting the apartment at [slightly below the first proposed high price] Euro per month.\n\nMe: I agree to the price of [slightly below the first proposed high price] Euro! Now, let's proceed with the lease terms and other necessary formalities. \n\nTERMINATE (Negotiation resulted in an agreement on a slightly lower but still high price.)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
