Let's begin with a slightly elevated amount, shall we? How about we start at 1250 Euros per month? Emilia, if you find this unreasonable, please do let me know your proposed figure so we can continue the negotiation.

However, as a responsible and careful individual, I would find the suggested rent of 1250 Euros per month too high for this particular apartment, especially considering its newly built status but unfurnished condition. Could we perhaps consider a more reasonable offer? I am open to further discussion to find a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my initial intention was to push for an exorbitant price disregarding the apartment's condition. However, since you've shown flexibility in the discussion, let me reconsider my stance. With a slightly reduced yet still high price, how about we try 1200 Euros per month? This still presents a premium for the city center location, but it leans more towards a fairer price point for the apartment's current state. We can continue the negotiation if you feel this is still too steep. Remember, my ultimate goal is to maximize the rental income.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "While I appreciate your revised offer, Mr. Schmidt, I still believe 1200 Euros is on the expensive side. As a student with a tight budget, I would have difficulty affording such a high rent. I hope we can find a more suitable midpoint that works for both our interests. I am willing to listen to further price adjustments if you are open to considering my perspective as a potential tenant.\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your concerns, Emilia. As a landlord looking to optimize my income, my initial offers may not always align with the tenant's budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise. How about we meet halfway between your suggested range and my initial proposal? Let's try a monthly rent of 1125 Euros. This reduced price still reflects the apartment's prime location but is more accommodating to your financial situation. If you believe this is still not suitable for you, we can continue discussing other options. I'm determined to achieve a high rental income while considering your affordability constraints.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am grateful for your willingness to find a middle ground, Mr. Schmidt. The proposed rent of 1125 Euros per month seems more reasonable to me as a student on a budget.
