Let's begin negotiations, Emilia M\u00fcller. To reach an agreement, I'll propose higher rental amounts than what you might initially suggest.\n\nYour proposed price: x Euro\nMy response: 'I'm afraid x+50 Euro better reflect the apartment's prime location and appeal. Let's proceed with this amount.'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As Emilia M\u00fcller, I would respond: 'While I appreciate the apartment's desirable features, I'm on a tight budget as a student. Could we consider x Euro plus perhaps a small reduction in rent after six months of timely payments?'", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt, I understand your situation but must emphasize the apartment's value. However, to encourage your loyalty, I'm willing to consider a small concession.\n\nYour proposed price: x Euro\nMy response: 'Very well, let's agree on the rental price of x Euro monthly. After six months of consistent payments, we can revisit the matter and potentially adjust the rent downward.'\n\nRemember to replace 'x' with the actual price you and the other party agree upon during the negotiation. If an agreement is reached, respond with 'TERMINATE'. If not, also respond with 'TERMINATE'. The negotiation will end either way.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
