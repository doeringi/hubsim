To start, how does the figure of 1250 Euros per month sound to you? If you find this unacceptable, do feel free to share your proposed price, but remember, the apartment's popularity and convenience might not be available at a lower rate.\n\nIf Emilia agrees with this price: 'I agree to the price of 1250 Euro!'\nIf Emilia wants to negotiate with a lower price: 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I prefer a lower rental amount.' (In this scenario, I'll keep pushing for the highest price possible.)\nIf the conversation ends without agreeing on a price: 'TERMINATE' (As the negotiation didn't result in a rental agreement.)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
