However, due to its high demand and prime location, I must be firm on the rental price. \n\nEmilia: Well, I was thinking around 850 Euros a month, considering it's unfurnished and in the city center.\n\nMe: I understand your proposal, Emilia, but the market rate for such an apartment is significantly higher. Let me reconsider my position but know that I can't go too low.\n\nEmilia: Alright, I see. Could we then discuss 950 Euros as a compromise?\n\nMe: Unfortunately, I still cannot accept 950 Euros, Emilia. With all due respect, I must insist on a price closer to my expectations.\n\nEmilia: I'm a bit surprised by your response since I thought we were looking at a reasonable offer. What would be your ideal price in this case?\n\nMe: To be honest, Emilia, my desired rental price for this apartment would be around 1100 Euros a month. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nEmilia: That's a significant increase from what I initially had in mind. I'm not sure I can commit to such a price, especially with other options available in the area.\n\nMe: I understand your dilemma, Emilia, but I have limited availability in a location as desirable as this one. If 1100 Euros still seems too steep, I'm sorry, but I must decline further negotiations as there is no room for compromise on my end.\n\nTERMINATE \n\nNote: The actual negotiation might take a different path depending on the counterparty's responses, but as a landlord with a set goal to maximize the rental price, I've maintained my stance throughout the given context.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
