However, considering my situation as a diligent and responsible student, I find this rent a bit steep for my budget. I'd be more comfortable with a rental price closer to the market average or slightly below it. Could we perhaps find some middle ground for a more affordable rate?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt, I understand your concern, but the apartment is in high demand due to its prime location and modern features. While I'm willing to be flexible to some extent, I must ensure a reasonable return on my investment.

While I appreciate the attempt to meet me halfway, as a student with limited resources, I'm still seeking an even lower price to match my financial capabilities. Would it be possible for us to negotiate around the 850 Euros mark? If not, I will seriously consider your offer at 900 Euros but will keep looking for more affordable options as well.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt, I have already made a significant concession in the rental price, but I do not want to lose a potentially stable tenant with strong financial prospects in the future. However, I must maintain a certain level of profitability for this investment property. I'm afraid I cannot go any lower than 900 Euros per month, Emilia. Please evaluate my offer carefully, as I do not wish to continue negotiations if you insist on a significantly lower rate. TERMINATE.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
