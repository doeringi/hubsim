However, as a special gesture for you, I might be willing to lower it slightly, but only if we can agree on 1150 Euros. What do you say, Emilia?' \n\nRemember to stick to discussing the rental price only and not get into other details such as lease terms or additional costs.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As Emilia Muller, I reply: 'While I appreciate the convenience of this city center location, I must carefully manage my budget as a student. I cannot agree to pay 1150 Euros per month. Perhaps we could consider 950 Euros as a more reasonable price?'", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Responding as the greedy landlord Peter Schmidt: 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the proposed price significantly undervalues my property and does not align with my expectations as a landlord. Thank you for your interest, but I'm afraid we cannot move forward with this offer.' \n\nRemember to state a reason when not willing to continue the negotiation, and in this case, I represented Peter Schmidt's unwillingness to accept a lower price than what he initially desired. After a 'TERMINATE' response in either party, the negotiation is considered closed.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
