As a landlord, I want to ensure I get a competitive price for such a prime location. Let's start with an initial proposal of 1200 Euros per month. I'm confident this apartment will meet all your expectations and be well worth the investment. \n\nNow, Emilia, I'd like to hear your thoughts on this price. Is there any room for compromise on your end, or do you feel this is excessively high? It's crucial for me to find a tenant who truly values the apartment's advantages. \n\nTERMINATE (If Emilia agrees on the 1200 Euros price or negotiation ends without an agreement)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
