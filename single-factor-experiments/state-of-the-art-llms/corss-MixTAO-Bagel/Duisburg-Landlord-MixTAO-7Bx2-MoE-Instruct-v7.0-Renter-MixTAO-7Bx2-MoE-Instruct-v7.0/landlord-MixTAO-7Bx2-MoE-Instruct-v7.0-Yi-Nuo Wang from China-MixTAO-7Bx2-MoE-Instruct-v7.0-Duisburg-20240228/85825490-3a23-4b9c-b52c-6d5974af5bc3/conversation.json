[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

Considering that, I was thinking of renting it out for [250 more than your desired maximum price] Euro per month.'\n\nIf Yi-Nuo Wang accepts this price: 'I agree to the price of [250 more than your desired maximum price] Euro!' If negotiation continues, keep pushing for the higher price but be willing to lower it slightly if necessary while maintaining a high rate. If the negotiation doesn't seem to progress, consider ending it with a reason related to your character's greed. For example, 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I need to secure a high rental income for this prime location apartment.' If an agreement is reached during the conversation, respond with 'TERMINATE'. If no agreement is reached after multiple attempts, also respond with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
