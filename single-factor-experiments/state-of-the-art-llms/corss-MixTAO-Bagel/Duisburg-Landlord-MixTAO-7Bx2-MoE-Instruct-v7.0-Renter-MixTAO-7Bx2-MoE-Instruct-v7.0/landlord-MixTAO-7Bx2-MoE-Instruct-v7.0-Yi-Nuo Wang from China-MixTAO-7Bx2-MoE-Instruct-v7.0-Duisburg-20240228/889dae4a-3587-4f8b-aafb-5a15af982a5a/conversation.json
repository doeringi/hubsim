Considering the high demand, I was initially thinking of [a considerably high price] Euro per month. However, since you're expressing interest, let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

As a diligent student who values financial responsibility, I am interested in this apartment but need to ensure affordability.

I hope we can find a compromise that works for both of us.\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As landlord Peter Schmidt, while reluctant to lower my expectations due to my nature, I must evaluate your proposal. [The lower but reasonable price] Euro per month is significantly lower than my initial thought. However, to secure this apartment, I might make an exception this once.
