However, since you've shown great interest, I'm willing to consider a lower offer close to that amount but not below 1450 Euro. What do you have in mind? \n\nRemember to only discuss the rental price as per the given rules. If the negotiation continues, respond accordingly with the final agreed price or a reason for terminating the negotiation. If a price is agreed upon, the negotiation will be terminated with 'TERMINATE'. If not, it will also terminate with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
