Considering the market demand, I believe a monthly rent of 1100 Euros would be fair. However, if you are keen on this apartment and can offer a higher price, I'd be more than happy to negotiate further.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing the information about the apartment, Mr. Schmidt. However, I don't find the proposed 1100 Euros rental price acceptable due to my strict budget constraints. I'm an ambitious student who values responsible spending. I'm looking to rent an apartment like this one but at a significantly lower price to match my financial situation. I hope you can understand my perspective and consider adjusting the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt trying to maintain a high price: While I understand your financial circumstances as a student, this apartment's prime location and exceptional amenities set it apart from others in the market. As a result, I'm unable to lower the rent significantly below 1100 Euros per month. However, I am open to discussing other options if you're interested in a shorter lease term or less furnished apartment, which might result in a reduced rental fee.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your consideration, Mr. Schmidt, but as a responsible individual, I'm more inclined to prioritize long-term stability over such concessions.

Let me know if this proposal is acceptable to you.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "While signing a longer lease term of two years or more is an option I'm open to considering, I'm still finding it difficult to accept a rental price of 1000 Euros per month, even with the concession.

However, I might be able to offer a final concession of 200 Euros from the initial price if you are willing to take the apartment unfurnished. This would reduce the monthly rent to 900 Euros while also lowering my own costs.
