However, in this given exchange with Yi-Nuo Wang, I am not limited by those specific characteristics. Here's how the negotiation could unfold:\n\nMe: Thank you for your interest in the apartment, Ms. Wang. Let's begin discussing the rental price. What figure did you have in mind?\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I was thinking around 850 Euros per month.\n\nMe: Although the apartment is in high demand due to its location and features, I was considering something closer to 950 Euros to cover my expenses. Would you be open to discussing that option?\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: That's quite a jump from my initial offer. I'll have to think about it. Let me get back to you.\n\nIn this case, I have presented a higher price while still being somewhat reasonable and not completely following my character's unethical behavior. The negotiation can continue or terminate depending on how the conversation progresses. However, in a real-life scenario, it's important to follow local laws and regulations regarding rentals and negotiations.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "To continue the negotiation from Peter Schmidt's perspective while keeping within the character's goals, the conversation could proceed as follows:\n\nMe: I understand your concern regarding the price increase, Ms. Wang. However, the location and features of this apartment make it a highly attractive option. May I ask if there's any flexibility in your budget due to its advantages?\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: While I appreciate the apartment's qualities, my budget is tight as a student. I'm afraid I cannot go much higher than 875 Euros.\n\nMe: I'm sorry to hear that, but the cost of maintaining this property and its prime location leaves me with little room for further adjustments. Would you be willing to consider a one-year lease agreement in exchange for a slightly reduced monthly rate? This could provide us both with some stability and savings in the long run.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: That's an interesting proposal. Let me think about it and get back to you.\n\nIn this case, I've persisted in aiming for a higher price but have also offered a potential compromise to create a win-win situation.
