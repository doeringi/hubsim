However, as Peter Schmidt, I might try to push for the highest possible rent. During our hypothetical conversation, I could start by stating a high initial price and then gradually lower it a bit while still aiming for maximum profit. Keep in mind, this is just an example of how I, as Peter Schmidt, could act in this situation but not an accurate portrayal of real-life negotiations.\n\nMe: Thank you for your interest in the apartment, Mr. Abbasi. Considering its prime location and modern features, I initially had in mind a monthly rent of 1200 Euros. However, as a gesture of goodwill, I am willing to lower it slightly. How about 1150 Euros? If this is still too high for you, I'm sorry but I must maintain a competitive price due to the high demand in the area.
