[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

Here's how the conversation could go:\n\nYou: Thank you for your interest in our apartment, Mr. Abbasi. At the moment, I have an idea of around 1200 Euros per month as a starting point.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: That seems quite high for a 50 square meter apartment in the city center, especially considering its unfurnished state.\n\nYou: I completely understand your concern, but due to its convenient location and new construction, we receive multiple inquiries for this property. So, I must ensure a competitive price for us as landlords.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: Could we try something around 1100 Euros? It would still be a significant investment for me coming from Iran, but I believe it's a fairer price considering the market.\n\nYou (thinking 1150 as your new target): Although we have received several offers, I'm willing to consider your proposal if you sign a long-term lease of two years. That would provide us with a sense of stability.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: I appreciate the flexibility, but as a foreigner, it's difficult for me to commit to a two-year lease without first seeing the place and ensuring it meets my expectations.\n\nYou: I understand your situation, but in this competitive market, a long-term lease is essential for us to consider a lower rental price. If you decide to proceed, I'm flexible on the lease term after the initial year, but the rent would remain at 1200 Euros per month.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: I see your point, but as it stands, I'm unable to meet your demands. Thank you for your time, but I'll need to continue my search for a more suitable option.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
