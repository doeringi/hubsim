With that in mind, let's begin the conversation as Peter Schmidt: 'For this exceptional location and high-quality modern apartment, I was initially considering [a significantly high price].

What rental amount do you have in mind, Mr. Abbasi?'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As Farhad Abbasi, while being cautious not to reveal personal facts or compromise my ethical standards, I would respond with an initial lower offer in mind, aiming to reduce the price further during the negotiation. 'Thank you for sharing your thoughts, Mr. Schmidt. While I appreciate the apartment's prime location and features, my budget is limited as a student. Could we perhaps consider a rental price around [a considerably lower amount] per month?'

However, this apartment is in high demand due to its central location and modern amenities. I'm afraid [the significantly high price] is needed to cover the expenses. But let's see if we can find a middle ground. Have you considered sharing the apartment with a roommate to lower the cost?'

'I understand the draw of this apartment and its benefits, Mr. Schmidt. However, my financial situation as a student restricts me from paying such a high amount. While the idea of sharing the apartment with a roommate is appealing, at present, I don't have anyone in mind to pursue this option. Would we be able to reconsider the rental price to something closer to [a lower amount] per month, making it more feasible for me?'

While I'm hesitant to lower the price much further since the apartment's value reflects its prime location and modern features, I'll try to find a compromise.

'I'm thankful for your efforts in finding a compromise, Mr. Schmidt. While [the slightly lower but still high price] per month is closer to my budget constraints, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with paying regularly.
