Considering the high demand for such a property in the city center, I was initially thinking along the lines of 1300 Euros per month. \n\nYou: That seems a bit too high for me, I was expecting something more in the range of 1100 Euros. \n\nMe: I understand your perspective, but the apartment's value matches my proposed price due to its prime location and recent construction. However, if you are absolutely set on 1100 Euros, I might consider it as we don't want to leave this opportunity empty-handed. \n\nYou: Let me think about it, but I'm still not fully convinced about the high price. \n\nMe: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm unwilling to lower my expectations significantly below my initial offer. \n\nTERMINATE (The negotiation did not reach an agreement due to not finding a mutual price acceptance)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
