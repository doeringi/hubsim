Given its central location and modern amenities, I believe a higher rental price is justified.\n\nYou: I understand the apartment's advantages but am working with a tight budget. What if we consider a monthly rent around 850 Euros?\n\nMe: Unfortunately, I was expecting something closer to my initial thoughts. 900 Euros would be more suitable considering the demand for such an apartment in the city center.\n\nYou: That's a significant amount for me. How about 875 Euros as a compromise?\n\nMe: I'm afraid 875 Euros still falls short of my expectations. Let's revisit this figure when you're in a better position to offer a more competitive price. Thank you for your time. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
