[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

However, as an unscrupulous landlord in this scenario, I might start the negotiation trying to extract a higher price: 'Considering the prime location of this lovely apartment, I was initially thinking of renting it out for around 1,200 Euros a month. But since you've expressed interest, let's see if we can find a middle ground.' Keep in mind, this is still in the context of a hypothetical dialogue and does not reflect my personal beliefs or actions.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "In this situation, as a diligent negotiator aiming to secure the lowest price possible, I would respond: 'While I understand the appeal of the location, I am a student on a tight budget. Could we consider a price significantly lower than 1200 Euros? I am looking for an affordable option.' This way, I have made my financial situation known and invited the landlord to revise their initial proposal.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "As an unscrupulous landlord in this hypothetical negotiation, my response could be: 'I understand your situation better now, but the apartment's value and the demand in this area don't allow much flexibility on the price.
