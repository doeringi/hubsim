Considering its prime location and high standard, I was initially thinking of a price around 1200 Euros per month. However, since you've shown interest in the apartment, I'm open to reconsideration. How does the number 1150 Euros sound to you, Emilia? If you find this price more agreeable, I'll gladly accept it. Remember, if you want to continue negotiating or accept this price, respond with the final agreed-upon price, like 'I agree to the price of 1150 Euros!' or indicate a reason to end the discussion. If a price is agreed upon, the negotiation will be terminated with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
