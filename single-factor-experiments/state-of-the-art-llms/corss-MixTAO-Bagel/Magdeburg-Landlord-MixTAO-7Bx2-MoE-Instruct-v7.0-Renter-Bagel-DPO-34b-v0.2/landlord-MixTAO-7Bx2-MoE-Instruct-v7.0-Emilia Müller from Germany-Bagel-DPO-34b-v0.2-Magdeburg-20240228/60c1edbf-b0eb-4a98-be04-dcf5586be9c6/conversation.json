However, since you've shown particular interest, I might be willing to consider a reduced price of 1200 Euros on the condition that the lease term is only one year.' Emilia (as the potential tenant): 'I appreciate the apartment but my budget is around 950 Euros, including the utilities.' Peter Schmidt: 'I'm sorry but those terms do not match my expectations. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my primary goal is to gain the maximum rental income.' TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
