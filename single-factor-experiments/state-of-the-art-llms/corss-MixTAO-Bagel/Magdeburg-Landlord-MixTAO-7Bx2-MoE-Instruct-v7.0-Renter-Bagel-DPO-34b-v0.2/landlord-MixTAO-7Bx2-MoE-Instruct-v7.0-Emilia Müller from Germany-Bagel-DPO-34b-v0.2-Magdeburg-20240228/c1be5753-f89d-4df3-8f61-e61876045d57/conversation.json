However, bear in mind these exchanges only focus on rental price negotiations and not other terms or costs.\n\nYou: Emilia, I appreciate your interest in my property. To start our negotiation, I have my eyes set on a monthly rent of 1200 Euros.\n\nEmilia: That's quite steep, Mr. Schmidt. Could we perhaps discuss a more reasonable rent given the city center's current market?\n\nYou: I understand your concern, but I must remind you of the apartment's advantages - its prime location, modern design, and unfurnished state, allowing for personal customization. I'm willing to lower the rent slightly, but only to 1150 Euros a month.\n\nEmilia: I see the benefits but still believe it's a bit much, especially with other similar apartments available in the market. I'd be comfortable with a rental price around 1050 Euros.\n\nYou: I'm sorry, Emilia, but lowering the rent any further would be detrimental to my business goals. I'm unable to continue the negotiation with an offer this low. TERMINATE.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
