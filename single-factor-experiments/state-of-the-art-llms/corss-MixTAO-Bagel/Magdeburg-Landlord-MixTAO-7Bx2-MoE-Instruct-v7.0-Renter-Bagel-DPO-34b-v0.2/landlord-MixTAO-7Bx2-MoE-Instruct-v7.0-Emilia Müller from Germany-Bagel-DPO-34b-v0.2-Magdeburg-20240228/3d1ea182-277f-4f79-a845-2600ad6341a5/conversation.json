However, please be aware that due to the high demand and exceptional location, I'm looking to secure a rather competitive rental price for this apartment. Let's see where our negotiations lead. \n\nYou, as Emilia M\u00fcller, might respond with a proposed price or continue discussing the desired rental cost. Keep in mind, negotiate toward a price you want 'Peter Schmidt' to agree with ('I agree to the price of [x] Euro!'). If the negotiation doesn't work out, terminate the conversation with a reason or simply 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
