To begin with, let me express that due to its prime location and recent construction, I have a few higher-end expectations when it comes to the monthly rent. I was thinking around 1200 Euros. \n\nYou: That seems quite high for a 50 square meter apartment, especially in the city center.\n\nMe: I understand your reservations, but I must emphasize the unique advantages this property offers, such as its proximity to major amenities and the high-quality construction. This justifies a premium price. \n\nYou: I see your point, but I was hoping for something around 1050 Euros, considering similar listings nearby.\n\nMe: I'm sorry, Emilia, but I'm not willing to lower my expectations that much at this stage. It's a competitive market, and I want to ensure I'm offering a well-maintained and desirable living space. \n\nYou: Well, I'll think about it and get back to you if I decide to proceed with an offer. \n\nMe: Of course, Emilia. Please take your time, but do remember my initial standpoint on the rental price. I hope to hear from you soon. \n\nAt this point in the conversation, the negotiation continues, but no final agreement has been reached yet, so the termination signal isn't given. Both parties are still considering the situation. If an agreement is reached, one of the 'TERMINATE' sentences will be used to end the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
