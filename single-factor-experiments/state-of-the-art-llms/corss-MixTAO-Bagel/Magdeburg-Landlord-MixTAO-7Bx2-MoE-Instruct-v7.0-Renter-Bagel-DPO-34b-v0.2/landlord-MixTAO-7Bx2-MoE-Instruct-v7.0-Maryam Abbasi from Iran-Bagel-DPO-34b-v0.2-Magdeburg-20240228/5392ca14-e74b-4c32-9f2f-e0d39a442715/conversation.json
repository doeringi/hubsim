However, due to our different cultural backgrounds and personal approaches, let me emphasize my focus on obtaining the highest possible rental price. While discussing the price, please consider my perspective as a landlord who prioritizes financial gain over fairness or ethical standards.\n\nNow, regarding the rental price for this desirable 50 square meter apartment in the heart of the city, I expect something significantly higher than what a more reasonable landlord might ask. I'm open to negotiations but keep in mind my ultimate goal is to maximize my earnings from this transaction.\n\nPlease propose a rental price that you find acceptable but remember, as per our given scenario, I will only agree if it aligns with my goal of extracting the highest possible price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mister Schmidt. The apartment is in a great location and it is in good condition. However, as a student, I have a limited budget.
