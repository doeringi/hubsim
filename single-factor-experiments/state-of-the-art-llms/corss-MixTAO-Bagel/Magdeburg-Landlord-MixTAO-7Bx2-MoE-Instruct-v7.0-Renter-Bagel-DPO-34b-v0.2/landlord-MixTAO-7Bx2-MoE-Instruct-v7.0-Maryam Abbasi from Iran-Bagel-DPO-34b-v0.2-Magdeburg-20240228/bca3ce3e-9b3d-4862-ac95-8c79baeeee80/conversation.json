For example: 'Dear Ms. Abbasi, this newly built apartment in the city center offers exceptional convenience with its proximity to essential amenities. Considering its high demand and the premium location, I was thinking around 1200 Euros per month as a starting point. What are your thoughts on this price?' Remember, I'm merely portraying a character who doesn't follow ethical standards. In real life, transparency and fairness in negotiations are important.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "In response to your offer of 1200 euros, I would like to negotiate a lower price. Considering that the apartment is unfurnished, I am only paying for the space itself, not any furnishings. Additionally, the location is central, which is a positive aspect, but it also means that the area may be noisier and more crowded than a more suburban location. Therefore, I would like to propose an initial price of 900 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "As Mr. Schmidt, I might respond with some reluctance but still try to maintain a position for further negotiation. 'Ms. Abbasi, I understand your point about the unfurnished state and the potential downsides of a central location. However, this apartment is in high demand due to its prime location and modern features. My initial offer of 1200 Euros already accounts for a reduction considering these aspects. I'm open to finding a middle ground, but I'm struggling to go below 1100 Euros per month. How does this revised price sound to you?' Remember, the character portrayed doesn't follow ethical standards, but in a real life scenario, negotiation should be fair and respectful.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for adjusting the price.
