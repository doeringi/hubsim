However, keep in mind our dialogue focus only on price and assumes no other factors are being discussed.\n\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you for your interest in our apartment, Ms. Abbasi. To start, I had initially planned to rent it out for 1200 Euros per month, but considering your travel from Iran, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's hear your proposed price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam Abbasi: That's quite high for my budget, Peter Schmidt. Could we consider something around 900 Euros per month? It would still be a considerable expense due to the distance, but it's within my range.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your situation, but this apartment is in high demand, and I've received other offers close to my initial price. However, I'm willing to make a slight reduction for you. How about 1150 Euros a month? It's still a premium location, and utilities are not included in the rent.\n\nMaryam Abbasi: Thank you for trying to accommodate me, but I'm afraid 1150 Euros is still not feasible for me. I'm looking for something around or just above the 1000 Euros mark.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I apologize for the inconvenience, but I'm unable to meet your proposed price due to the aforementioned circumstances. It's been a pleasure discussing this with you, but I don't want to continue the negotiation, as lowering the price further would not be in my best interest.
