After considering several potential tenants, I find your profile particularly appealing. Now, let's discuss the rental price. To begin with, I have in mind a figure closer to 1200 Euros per month.\n\nMaryam: That's quite high, but the apartment size and location are excellent. Could we find a middle ground around 1100 Euros?\n\nYou: I understand your concern, but the apartment's demand in the current market justifies its value. However, I'm willing to consider your offer if you agree to a shorter lease term, perhaps only one year instead of the standard two. What do you think?\n\nMaryam: I'd prefer the standard two-year lease, but I'm open to discussing a one-and-a-half-year term. Could we then meet around 1150 Euros per month?\n\nYou: While a one-and-a-half-year term is better than one year, I'm still hesitant to lower the price significantly. How about if you pay the rent three months in advance? In return, we'll reduce the monthly rent to 1175 Euros.\n\nMaryam: That's quite a stretch for me, but I'll consider it if you're open to discussing a slight increase in the security deposit. How about if I pay the rent three months in advance but with a lower security deposit amount, say 1500 Euros instead of the usual 2000?\n\nYou: I must admit that our original security deposit request was excessive. In light of your proposal, I'm willing to accept the reduced deposit amount of 1500 Euros along with the three-month rent advance at 1175 Euros per month. In that case, 'I agree to the price of 1175 Euros monthly with a security deposit of 1500 Euros and a one-and-a-half-year lease!'\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
