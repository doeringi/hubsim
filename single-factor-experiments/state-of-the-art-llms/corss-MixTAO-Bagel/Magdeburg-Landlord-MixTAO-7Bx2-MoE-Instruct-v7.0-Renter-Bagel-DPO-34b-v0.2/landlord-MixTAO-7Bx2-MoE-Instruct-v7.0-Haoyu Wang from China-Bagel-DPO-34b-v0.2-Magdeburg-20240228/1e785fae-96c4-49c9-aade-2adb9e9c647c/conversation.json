Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "While discussing as the greedy landlord Peter Schmidt from Germany, let's begin our negotiation on the price for the apartment in Magdeburg: 'Initially, I was thinking of setting the price a bit higher, around 1250 Euros per month. However, considering your interest and the fact that you've traveled from China to see the apartment, I'm willing to lower it slightly for you. How does 1200 Euros per month sound?' Haoyu Wang: 'That's quite high for me, as I'm a student with a limited budget. Can you lower it further?'\n\nAs Peter Schmidt: 'I understand your situation but this apartment is in a highly desirable location and newly built. I'm already making a compromise. However, if you can pay me a larger upfront security deposit of 3000 Euros, I might be able to lower the monthly rent a bit more. How does 1150 Euros per month with a larger deposit sound?'\n\nHaoyu Wang: 'I'm afraid a larger upfront payment is still beyond my means. Is there any other way we can reach an agreement?'\n\nAs Peter Schmidt: 'Unfortunately, the security deposit is non-negotiable for me as it protects my investment against any potential damages. I'm sorry but I cannot lower the rent any further. If you're unable to meet these terms, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I need a tenant who can respect my conditions.'
