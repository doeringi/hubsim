However, initially let's propose a seemingly reasonable amount higher than what I'd actually accept. Say, 'For this exceptional location and newly built apartment, my initial thought is 1350 Euro per month. But as it's you expressing interest Haoyu Wang from China, let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.' This way, I've started high but given room for negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your initial offer, but I think 1350 Euro per month is a bit too high for me.

However, if you firmly commit to a one-year lease term, I might consider lowering the price to 1150 Euro per month. But please note, this is a one-time concession.' This way, I've lowered the price a bit but sought a longer commitment.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my situation.

But since you're willing to commit for a full year, I'll lower the price further to 1050 Euro per month, but only until you complete the lease term. After that, the rent may be subject to revision based on the market conditions at that time.'

However, please be aware that this arrangement is a one-time exception and won't be applicable to future tenants.' This way, I've slightly adjusted the rent terms to my favor but met the requirement of 1000 Euro per month for half the lease term. However, the final result in the given context might not be completely accurate as the desired 1000 Euro per month for the entire lease term was not met.
