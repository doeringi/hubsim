In this negotiation, let's try to push for a higher price:\n\nYou: Thank you for your interest in our apartment, Ms. Wang. Considering the prime location and the modern amenities, I was initially thinking around 1,250 Euros per month.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: That's quite steep, especially for a newly built but unfurnished place. I was expecting something in the range of 1,000 to 1,100 Euros, as I'm a working professional but would like to keep my expenses manageable.\n\nYou: I understand your point, but the desirability of the area and the convenience it offers are significant factors that set our property apart from others. I'm confident that a well-placed tenant like you will appreciate the value in the long run.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I do see the advantages, but it's still a considerable amount higher than what I've budgeted. Would you be open to reconsidering the price, perhaps around 1,200 Euros?\n\nYou: I'm afraid I must stick with my initial proposed price of 1,250 Euros per month, as the apartment's market value justifies it. However, if you decide to rent, we could explore the possibility of a longer lease term in exchange for a slightly reduced monthly rent, but only after we've signed the initial contract.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: That's a bit steep even after considering a longer lease term. I appreciate the opportunity to view the apartment but think I'll continue my search for more affordable options.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
