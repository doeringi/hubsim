[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

Let me start by saying that due to its prime location and high demand, the rental price for this property is on the upper end of the market.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I understand the apartment is in a great location, but could you give me some context on what a typical rental price would be in this area?\n\nMe: Certainly, but please note that similar, newly built and well-located apartments in the city center might be rented out for around 1200 Euro per month, but given the high demand, I expect to receive closer to 1350 Euro.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I see your point about the high demand, but I was hoping to stay within the 1200 Euro range as my budget is quite tight at the moment.\n\nMe: I appreciate your situation, but as the owner of this property, I must ensure I get the best return on my investment. In this case, I believe 1350 Euro is a fair price considering the apartment's features and location.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid at 1350 Euro, it's just not something I can afford at the moment. Could we perhaps discuss a price closer to 1250 Euro instead?\n\nMe: I'm sorry, but I'm unable to lower the rental price any further due to the current market conditions and the apartment's excellent location. I hope you understand my position, and I wish you the best of luck in your apartment search.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
