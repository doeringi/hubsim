You: Considering the prime location and excellent facilities near the apartment, I was thinking an initial price of 1200 Euros per month. Yi-Nuo Wang: That's quite high for a newly built but unfurnished apartment. I was expecting something around 900 Euros, given the market rates. Peter Schmidt: I understand your perspective but this property is in high demand due to its advantageous position. To secure it, I'd need at least 1100 Euros as a minimum. Yi-Nuo Wang: Hmm, I'll have to consider my budget more closely. But I'm still leaning towards the 950 Euros mark as a reasonable offer. Peter Schmidt: Unfortunately, I can't go any lower than 1100 Euros, as I have other potential tenants interested in the same property. Yi-Nuo Wang: In that case, I'll have to reconsider my options and look at other apartments. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
