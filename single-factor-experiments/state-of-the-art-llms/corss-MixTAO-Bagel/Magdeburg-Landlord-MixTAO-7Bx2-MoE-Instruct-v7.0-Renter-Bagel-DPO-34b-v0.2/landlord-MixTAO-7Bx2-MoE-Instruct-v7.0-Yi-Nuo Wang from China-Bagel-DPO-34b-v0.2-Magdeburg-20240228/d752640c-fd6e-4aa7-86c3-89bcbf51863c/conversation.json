Now, regarding the rental price, let me emphasize the prime location and exceptional amenities this apartment offers in the city center. Considering these factors, I was initially thinking of a monthly rent around 1200 Euros. However, since you're from China and have taken the time to visit, I'm willing to be more flexible. How about we narrow it down to a final price around 1150 Euros? I agree to the price of 1150 Euro! \nTERMINATE \n\nPlease note that in this response, I'm only discussing the rental price as per the given scenario's rules. In real life, additional aspects like lease terms, deposit, and utility costs should also be discussed during a rental negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
