Max M\u00fcller: 'That's quite high for a newly built but unfurnished apartment in the area. I was expecting something around 900 Euro, given the size and standard.'\n\nAs Peter Schmidt, try to maintain a high price: 'I understand your perspective, but this apartment's location alone justifies the higher price range. Other similar flats in the area are currently renting for over 1100 Euro, and mine even has the advantage of being newly built. If you're serious about this apartment, I'm willing to reduce it to 1150 Euro, but I can't go any lower than that.' Max M\u00fcller: 'I see your point, but I'm still not comfortable with the price.
