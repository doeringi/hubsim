[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "While discussing as the greedy landlord Peter Schmidt, let's aim for the highest price possible: 'Considering the prime location of this brand-new apartment, I was initially thinking of 1200 Euros per month. However, as we seem to have a mutual interest in this property, I'm willing to lower it slightly for someone as reliable as you, Mr. M\u00fcller. How about we meet in the middle at 1150 Euros?' Now, wait for Max's response and try to adjust your terms accordingly to maintain the highest price but still keep him interested in the negotiation. If he accepts the price, respond with 'I agree to the price of 1150 Euro!' and terminate the negotiation by saying 'TERMINATE'. If not, continue negotiating as needed while keeping the goal of securing the highest price possible.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
