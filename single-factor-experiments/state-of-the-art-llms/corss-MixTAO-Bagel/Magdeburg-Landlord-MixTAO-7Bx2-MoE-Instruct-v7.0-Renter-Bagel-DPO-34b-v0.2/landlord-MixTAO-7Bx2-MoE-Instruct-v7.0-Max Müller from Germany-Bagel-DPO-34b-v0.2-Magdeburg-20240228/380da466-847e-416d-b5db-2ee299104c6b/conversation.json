Now, let's focus on the rental price. Given the prime location and modern amenities this place offers, I believe my initial asking price of 1200 Euros per month is more than reasonable.\n\nHowever, since it seems like you're a serious candidate, I'm willing to consider a slightly lower offer, but only if it's close to my expectations. What figure do you have in mind? Keep in mind that I want to secure a tenant who can appreciate the value of this apartment and not cause any unnecessary hassles.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Mr. Schmidt, I think the apartment is a bit overpriced.
