However, due to its prime location and exceptional features, I've received multiple inquiries and must be cautious with my decision. My initial thought for this unit is [a significantly higher price than the average market rate in Magdeburg] Euros per month. I'm open to discussion, but I must emphasize the apartment's high demand and exclusivity.'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As a German student, I could not afford such a high price. I am looking for an apartment that fits into my budget. How about if I offer 400 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As the landlord Peter Schmidt, reluctant but still aiming for a higher price: 'I understand your situation as a student, Max, but the apartment's value far exceeds the price I mentioned earlier. With the current interest, I'm afraid I cannot accept anything less than [a price slightly higher than the initially proposed but still much higher than 400 Euros] Euros per month. I suggest you consider your options carefully, as this opportunity might not present itself again soon.'\n\nIn this negotiation, the landlord is trying to keep the rent high while acknowledging the student's financial situation as a concession but not lowering the price to the level the student is offering. The negotiation can only be terminated if an agreement is reached on the price or if one party decides not to continue due to an unacceptable situation. In this case, the negotiation continues as there's no agreement on the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, but 400 Euros is the maximum I can pay for an apartment. I am a responsible student, and I can assure you that I will take good care of the apartment. I don't want to use it for parties or any other inappropriate activities. I always follow the rules and I am dependable. I can also sign a three-year lease. How about if we meet in the middle and I pay 450 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As the landlord Peter Schmidt, still trying to maintain the high rent but considering the offered compromise: 'Max, I appreciate your assurances and am glad to hear about your responsible nature. However, my initial justification for the higher price is based on a variety of factors, including the apartment's newness, location, and demand. Nonetheless, I'm open to a longer lease duration as it offers stability. In light of your proposal and the three-year lease commitment, I'll reluctantly agree to a monthly rent of [450 Euros, which is still higher than the initial offer but lower than the initially mentioned high price] Euros. I look forward to having you as a tenant and hope you enjoy your stay.'\n\nIn this negotiation, the landlord is trying to maintain a high rent but is willing to accept a lower price in exchange for a long lease term commitment. The student, in turn, is willing to pay a higher rent than initially offered but still within their budget, in exchange for a better deal on the lease term. This compromise results in a mutually acceptable agreement.
