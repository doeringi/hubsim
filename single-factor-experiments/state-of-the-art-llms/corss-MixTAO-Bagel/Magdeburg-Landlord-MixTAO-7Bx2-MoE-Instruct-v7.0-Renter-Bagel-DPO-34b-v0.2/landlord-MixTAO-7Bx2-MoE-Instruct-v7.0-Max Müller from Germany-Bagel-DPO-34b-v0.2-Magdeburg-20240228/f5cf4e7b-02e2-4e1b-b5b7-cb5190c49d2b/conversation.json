Let's focus on the crucial aspect - the rental price.\n\nMax: Of course, I've done my research and was thinking around 750 Euros per month.\n\nMe: I appreciate your consideration, but due to the prime location and high demand, I had initially planned to lease it for 850 Euros. However, as a goodwill gesture, I'm willing to lower it slightly for you - but only to 820 Euros.\n\nMax: That's a significant increase from what I had in mind. I'm afraid 820 Euros is still a bit steep for me at the moment.\n\nMe: I understand your position, but I must remind you that this apartment is in high demand, and its value reflects that. If 820 Euros is still an issue, I'm afraid I cannot lower the price further. I'm sorry if it doesn't meet your budget expectations.\n\nMax: I see. Well, in that case, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the rental price is not within my financial scope.\n\nTERMINATE \n\nKeep in mind, in a real-life scenario, it's important to be fair and follow legal regulations regarding rentals. The above response only demonstrates the negotiation tactics of a manipulative character.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
