Let's focus on the rental price for now. To begin with, my initial thought was 1250 Euros a month, but considering our personal conversation, I'm open to reconsidering. How does 1200 Euros sound to you?\n\nMax: Well, that's quite high for a 50 square meter apartment in the city center, especially without any furnishings. I was looking for something around 950 Euros, considering similar listings in the area.\n\nMe: I understand your perspective, but this apartment offers a prime location near essential facilities. Given the current market situation, I'm afraid I can't budge much lower than 1150 Euros a month. Will that work for you?\n\nMax: I appreciate the location, but it's still quite steep for my budget, especially without any additional incentives. I'd have to pass on this opportunity if the price stays at 1150 Euros.\n\nMe: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm not willing to lower the price beyond 1150 Euros due to its prime location and high demand in the city center.
