I think the price is a little bit too high for me. I am willing to pay 800 Euro per month, considering the apartment is unfurnished and I have to buy furniture myself.\nPlease, lower the price a bit. I am a dependable and responsible tenant. I am a student but I have a part-time job and I am on a tight budget. I want to be on good terms with you, but I also want to rent your apartment.\nI hope we can find an agreement that suits us both.\nTherefore, I propose 800 Euro per month as a fair price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt, I appreciate your determination to secure this apartment but find your proposed price unsatisfactory considering my initial expectations.

Please understand that this is still a considerable amount above your initial offer, but it shows my flexibility in finding a common ground.
