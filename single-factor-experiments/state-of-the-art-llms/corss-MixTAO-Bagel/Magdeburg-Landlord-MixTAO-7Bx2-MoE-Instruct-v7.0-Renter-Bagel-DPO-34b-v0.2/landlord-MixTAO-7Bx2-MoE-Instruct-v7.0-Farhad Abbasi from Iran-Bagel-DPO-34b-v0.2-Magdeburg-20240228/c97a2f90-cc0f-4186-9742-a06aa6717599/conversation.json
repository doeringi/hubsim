However, as Peter Schmidt, I might attempt to use various tactics to secure a higher rental price. Here's a potential negotiation:\n\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you for your interest in the apartment, Mr. Abbasi. Let's focus on the rental price for now.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: Of course, I was thinking around 700 Euros per month.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your interest, but my initial thoughts were closer to 850 Euros due to the prime location and high demand.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: That's quite steep, especially considering it's unfurnished. I was expecting something more in the range of 750 Euros, given the market average for similar flats in Magdeburg.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern, but demand for central unfurnished apartments in Magdeburg has been rising, and I'm receiving multiple inquiries for this particular property. It's an attractive option for professionals who value proximity to important facilities.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: I'm a professional as well, but 850 Euros is still a stretch for my budget, especially with other living expenses. Could we consider 800 Euros as a compromise?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I'm reluctant to lower the price much more, but if it means securing a tenant who will respect the property and lease terms, I'm willing to consider 820 Euros as our final agreement. I agree to the price of 820 Euro! TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
