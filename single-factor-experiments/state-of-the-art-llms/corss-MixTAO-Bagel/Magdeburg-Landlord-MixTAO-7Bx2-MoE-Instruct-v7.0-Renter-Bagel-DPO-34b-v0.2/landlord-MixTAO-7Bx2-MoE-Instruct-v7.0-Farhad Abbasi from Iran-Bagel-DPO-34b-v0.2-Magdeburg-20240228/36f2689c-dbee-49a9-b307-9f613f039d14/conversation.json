However, in this response, I'm just an AI assistant giving you a potential dialogue.\n\nYou: Thank you for expressing interest in the apartment, Mr. Abbasi. As a landlord seeking the highest price possible, let's begin with a proposal of 1300 Euros per month.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: That's quite high for this area and apartment size, don't you think?\n\nYou: Well, the location is premium and it's a newly built apartment with modern amenities, which justifies a competitive price.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: I understand your point, but my budget is limited. Could we consider 1150 Euros per month?\n\nYou: I'm afraid I can't go that low, as I have other interested tenants who are willing to pay closer to my asking price. However, if you can show me a strong proof of income and sign a longer lease term, I might consider a slight adjustment.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: I'm an engineer working for a multinational company and my income is stable. I'm comfortable with a two-year lease. But I can't go above 1200 Euros per month.\n\nYou: That's a significant improvement from your initial offer, but I'm still receiving better proposals. If you're willing to pay an additional deposit equal to one month's rent, I might reconsider my decision.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: I appreciate your position, but I'm not in a financial situation to provide an extra deposit. I wish the rental price was more flexible.\n\nYou: In that case, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your offer doesn't align with my financial expectations for this property.
