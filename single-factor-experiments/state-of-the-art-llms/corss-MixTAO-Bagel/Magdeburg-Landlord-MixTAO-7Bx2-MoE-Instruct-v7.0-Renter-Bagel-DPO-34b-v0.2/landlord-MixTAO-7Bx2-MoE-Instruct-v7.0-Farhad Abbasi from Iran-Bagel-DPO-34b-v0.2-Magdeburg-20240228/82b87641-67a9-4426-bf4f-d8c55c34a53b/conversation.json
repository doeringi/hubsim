He might say something like: 'Mr. Abbasi, I'm delighted to have you express interest in our exceptional property. Due to its prime location and top-notch amenities, I'm afraid the current market demands a rather competitive rental price. Let me start with an initial figure of 1200 Euros per month. However, I'm open to reconsidering should you believe it to be unreasonable.'

As Farhad Abbasi, I will now reply to Peter Schmidt's offer.\n\n[yourname], I appreciate your offer. However, I believe the price is too high. The apartment is unfurnished and newly built, which means there will be some inconvenience in the initial period. Moreover, although the location is central, it's not in the most upscale area.

However, let me try a different tactic. 'Although I understand your perspective, Mr. Abbasi, I must emphasize the exceptional qualities of this apartment that justify the current proposed rent. The central location is not only close to all necessary amenities but also in a rapidly developing area with an increasing demand for housing. Additionally, the apartment's high-quality construction and modern amenities make it an exceptional choice. I'm willing to reduce the price slightly, but I stand firm at 1100 Euros per month as a fair compromise.'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "[yourname], I am willing to meet you halfway.
