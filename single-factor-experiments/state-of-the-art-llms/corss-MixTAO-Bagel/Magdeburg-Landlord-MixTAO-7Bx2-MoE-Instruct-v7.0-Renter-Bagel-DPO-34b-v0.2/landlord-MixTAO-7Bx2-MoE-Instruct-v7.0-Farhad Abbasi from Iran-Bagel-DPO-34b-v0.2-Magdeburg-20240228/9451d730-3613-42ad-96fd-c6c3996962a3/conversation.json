The apartment is newly built with a desirable size and location in the city center, which increases its value. I'm afraid 800 Euros might not be sufficient to cover my expenses and maintenance costs. With this in mind, I'm willing to lower my initial price slightly, but I'm still aiming for something closer to 1150 Euros a month.
