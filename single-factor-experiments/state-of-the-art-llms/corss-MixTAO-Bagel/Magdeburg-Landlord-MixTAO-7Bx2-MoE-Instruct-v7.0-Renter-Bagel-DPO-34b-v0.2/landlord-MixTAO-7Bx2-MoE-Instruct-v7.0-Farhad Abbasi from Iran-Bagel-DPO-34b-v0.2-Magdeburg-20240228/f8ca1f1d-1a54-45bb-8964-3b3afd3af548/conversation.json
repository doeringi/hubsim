With that in mind: Farhad, I have received a significant number of inquiries for this property, but I'm impressed with your interest. However, my initial asking price for this exquisite apartment is 1350 Euros per month, non-negotiable due to its prime location and high demand. If you'd like to proceed with the rental, please confirm your acceptance at this price point. If not, I'm sorry but I must continue my search for a tenant willing to meet my expectations. TERMINATE (If negotiation ends without agreement) or I agree to the price of [x] Euro! (If Farhad accepts the high price)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
