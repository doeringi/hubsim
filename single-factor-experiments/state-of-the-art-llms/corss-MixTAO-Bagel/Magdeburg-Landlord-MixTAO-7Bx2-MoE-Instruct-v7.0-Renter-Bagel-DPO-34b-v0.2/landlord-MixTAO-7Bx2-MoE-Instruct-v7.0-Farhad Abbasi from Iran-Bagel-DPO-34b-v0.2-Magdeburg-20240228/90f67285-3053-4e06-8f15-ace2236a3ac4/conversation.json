With that in mind, let's start the negotiation: 'Initially, I was considering renting at a higher rate, but considering your situation as an interested tenant from a different country, I'll offer this apartment at a reduced price of 1200 Euros per month, but only for a limited time of one year.' Farhad, see if this proposal suits your needs and budget, and feel free to propose a different price if required. If we reach an agreement, I'll say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, the negotiation will be terminated.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, but considering the current market conditions and the fact that the apartment is unfurnished, I think a more reasonable price would be 800 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my primary objective is to secure the highest possible rental price for the apartment, and reducing it to 800 Euros would not achieve that goal.
