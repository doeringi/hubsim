[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

He could start by stating a high initial price and then gradually lower it while insinuating that the current offer is still quite favorable for him, despite its apparent generosity.\n\nYou: The apartment in such a prime location with all the amenities is certainly worth considering. However, my budget is limited and I was thinking around 800 Euros per month.\n\nSchmidt (thinking of a higher price but willing to start the negotiation): I understand your situation but let me clarify, this luxurious apartment in the city center is truly unique and in high demand. My initial thought for the rental price was 1100 Euros, but considering your budget constraints, I am willing to make a concession. How about we meet halfway at 950 Euros?\n\nYou: That's quite steep for me, but I'll see what I can manage. Let me think about it for a day.\n\nSchmidt: I appreciate your interest in the property, but I must remind you that due to the high demand and the exceptional location, this price might not remain the same for long. If you decide against it, other potential tenants would gladly accept the offer. Please reconsider and let's finalize the deal as soon as possible.
