Considering its prime location in the city center and the modern features, I was thinking around 1200 Euro per month as a starting point.\n\nYou: That sounds quite high for a 50 square meter apartment, especially when comparing it to other options in the area.\n\nMe: I understand your concern, but the apartment's proximity to important facilities and its newly built condition make it an exceptional choice for tenants who prioritize convenience and comfort.\n\nYou: I can appreciate the benefits, but I'm looking to keep my monthly expenses around 1000 Euro. Can you be more flexible on the price?\n\nMe: Mr. Abbasi, I'm sorry but I cannot lower the price below 1150 Euro at the moment due to the high demand in the area and the quality of the apartment.\n\nYou: That's disappointingly close to what I'm willing to pay, but I'm not certain if I can stretch my budget this far. Let me consider my options and get back to you.\n\nMe: I understand your situation, but please note that interest in this apartment is high and other potential tenants might not have the same flexibility as you. I hope you make the best decision for your needs. TERMINATE.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
