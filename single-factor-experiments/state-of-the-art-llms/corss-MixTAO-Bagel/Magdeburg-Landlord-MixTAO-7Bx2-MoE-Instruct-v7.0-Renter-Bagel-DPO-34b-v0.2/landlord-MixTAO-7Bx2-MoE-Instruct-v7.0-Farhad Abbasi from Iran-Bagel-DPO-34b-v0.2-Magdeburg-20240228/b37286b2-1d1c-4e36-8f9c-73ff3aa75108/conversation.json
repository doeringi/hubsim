Now, let's focus on the rental price negotiation.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: Of course, I have a budget in mind but would like a competitive price.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern, Mr. Abbasi. However, due to the prime location and the high demand for our newly built apartments, we have received multiple inquiries. As a result, I must emphasize the importance of a competitive price reflecting the property's value.\n\nYou: With respect, Mr. Schmidt, could you please share a specific rental price that you have in mind for this apartment?\n\nPeter Schmidt: Considering the market trends and your expressed interest, I can offer you this exceptional apartment at 1200 Euros per month. This price is reasonable given the apartment's features and location.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: I appreciate the offer, but I'm afraid my budget is limited and can't accommodate such a high monthly rent. Could we perhaps discuss another price range?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Abbasi. But as I mentioned earlier, the demand for these apartments is extremely high, and I have other potential tenants waiting. I'm afraid I cannot lower the rental price under these circumstances.\n\nYou: If the price cannot be adjusted, I regret to inform you that this apartment may not be a suitable option for me at the moment.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my priority is to secure a tenant willing to pay the market value for the property.
