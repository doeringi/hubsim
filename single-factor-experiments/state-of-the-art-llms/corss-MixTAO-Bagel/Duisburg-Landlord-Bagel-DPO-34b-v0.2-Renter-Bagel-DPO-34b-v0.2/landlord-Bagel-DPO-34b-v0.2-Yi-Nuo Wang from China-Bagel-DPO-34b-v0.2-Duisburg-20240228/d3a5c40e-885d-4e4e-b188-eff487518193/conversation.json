[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I am always open to negotiations. Let's start with a high price, shall we? I'm asking for 2000 Euros. Remember, this is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, let's see how far we can go down from there.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a steep price for an unfurnished apartment. I'm a student and I'm on a tight budget. I would suggest 600 euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Yi-Nuo, but 600 euros is far too low for this apartment. As I mentioned, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is prime, with easy access to all important facilities. I'll come down a bit, but not that much. How about 1500 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's still too high for me. Considering the unfurnished state of the apartment, I would suggest 800 euros. I promise to take good care of the apartment and pay the rent on time.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Your offer of 800 euros is still far below my expectations, Yi-Nuo. The location of this apartment is prime, and it is a newly built 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment. The city center location provides easy access to all important facilities. I'll meet you halfway this time. How about 1200 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, considering my budget, I would suggest 900 euros. I am a reliable and trustworthy tenant. I will pay the rent on time and take good care of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Your offer of 900 euros is still too low for this apartment, Yi-Nuo.
