[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Max, glad to meet you. Let's start with a high price to see how much you're willing to pay. How does 1000 euros sound? Remember, this is a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is quite a lot of money for an unfurnished apartment. I am a student and I have a limited budget. Would you be willing to go lower?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Sure, I can go lower, but how low are you willing to go? Remember, this is a great location in the city center, and it's quite convenient for students with its proximity to important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I would be more comfortable with 750 euros per month. I could then afford to furnish the apartment and still have some money left for my studies.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite a drop from my last offer. I can consider it, but I'm aiming for a higher price for this apartment. Let's meet in the middle, how about 875 euros? It's a fair price for a fair apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your fairness. However, I still think 750 euros is a more reasonable price for an unfurnished apartment. I am willing to pay more for a furnished apartment, but for unfurnished, 750 euros is my highest offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, but 750 euros is too low for this apartment. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price you're offering is too far from what I'm looking for. Remember, this is a great location in the city center, and it's quite convenient for students with its proximity to important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your position. However, I am willing to pay 800 euros per month. I hope this offer meets your expectations.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a better offer, but I'm still aiming for more. Let's meet in the middle, how about 850 euros? It's a fair price for a fair apartment.
