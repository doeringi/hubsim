While the 600 Euros per month is lower than my initial counteroffer, it still pushes my budget a little higher than what I had initially expected for this particular apartment. However, considering its prime location and other factors, I am willing to slightly adjust my stance and negotiate further. I agree to the price of 590 Euros per month for this apartment as a compromise, but please understand that it's my final offer reflecting my financial limitations as a student. If we cannot reach an agreement at this price point, I must sadly consider other options in my apartment hunt. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
