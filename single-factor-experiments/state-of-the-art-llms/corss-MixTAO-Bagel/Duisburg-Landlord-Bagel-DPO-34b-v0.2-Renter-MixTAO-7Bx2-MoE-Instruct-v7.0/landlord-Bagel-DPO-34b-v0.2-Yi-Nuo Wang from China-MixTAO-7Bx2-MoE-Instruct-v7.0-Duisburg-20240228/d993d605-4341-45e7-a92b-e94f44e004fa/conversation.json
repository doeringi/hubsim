However, I'm open to discussing further during negotiations.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your position, but I'm afraid I can't let the price drop significantly from the market rate.

While my budget is primarily focused on affordability as a student, I am willing to go slightly above my initial proposal if it means bridging the gap between our expectations more effectively. Let's say my highest acceptable price, while still maintaining a balance between my financial capabilities and the apartment's value, is a rental rate that's around 10% lower than the market value. This demonstrates my intent to find common ground and reach an agreement that suits both our interests. However, if the difference remains too significant, I may have to reconsider my decision and explore other options.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still looking to get the highest price possible for my apartment.

As a student, my financial constraints are a primary concern, but I am still willing to make an effort to find a middle ground that satisfies both our needs. With this in mind, I'm prepared to raise my proposed rent price further, possibly settling at a rate that's around 8% less than the market value. This increased offer signifies my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution while taking into account my available budget and the apartment's exceptional qualities. If the gap in our expectations narrows even more, I may find myself in a position to accept the rental terms and look forward to calling this apartment my home. However, if we cannot reach a compromise that works for both parties, I may have to seek alternative living arrangements.
