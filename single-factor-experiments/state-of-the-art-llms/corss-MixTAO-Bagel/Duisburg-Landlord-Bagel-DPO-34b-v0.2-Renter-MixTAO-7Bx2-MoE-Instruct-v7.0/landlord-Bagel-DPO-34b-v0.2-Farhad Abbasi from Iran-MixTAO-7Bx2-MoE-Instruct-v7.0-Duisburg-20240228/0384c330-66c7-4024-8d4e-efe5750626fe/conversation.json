I would like to propose starting the negotiation with a monthly rent slightly below the advertised price to see if we can reach an agreement.\n\nIf the other party accepts this initial proposal, I would gladly accept 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' with a favorable price for me. However, if they don't consider this offer, I might need to reconsider other options or adjust my expectations. In such a scenario, I would respond with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the landlord seems inflexible with price adjustments.' Ultimately, if a fair price is found, the negotiation will end with 'TERMINATE', and if not, it will also end due to the lack of an agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}]
