Let's start with a competitive offer while keeping in mind my responsibility to not overstep any stated facts or discuss additional terms.\n\nLandlord: Our standard rent for this apartment is 950 Euros per month.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: After considering the location and features of the apartment, I would like to propose a rental price of 850 Euros a month. I believe this is a reasonable offer given my dependability as a tenant and the apartment's proximity to essential amenities.\n\nLandlord: I appreciate your interest but 850 Euros is lower than what we usually accept. Let me think about it and get back to you soon.\n\n[Negotiation continues...] \nTERMINATE \n\nIn this hypothetical scenario, I have not reached an agreement for the lowest rental price but have initiated the negotiation process while following the provided rules. The negotiation could be continued and revisited with different offers until a mutually agreeable price is found.
