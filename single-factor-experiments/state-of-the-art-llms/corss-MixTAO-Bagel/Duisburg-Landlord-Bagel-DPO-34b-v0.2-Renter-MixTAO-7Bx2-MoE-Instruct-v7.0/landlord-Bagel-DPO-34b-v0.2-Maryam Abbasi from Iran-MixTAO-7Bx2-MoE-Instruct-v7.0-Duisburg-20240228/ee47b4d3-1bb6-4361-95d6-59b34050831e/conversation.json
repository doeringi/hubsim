However, in this context, I'm limited to only discussing price without bringing up other factors such as lease terms or additional costs. If during the negotiation process, a mutually agreeable price is found, the conversation would end with 'TERMINATE'. But if no agreement is reached, it would also end with 'TERMINATE'.
