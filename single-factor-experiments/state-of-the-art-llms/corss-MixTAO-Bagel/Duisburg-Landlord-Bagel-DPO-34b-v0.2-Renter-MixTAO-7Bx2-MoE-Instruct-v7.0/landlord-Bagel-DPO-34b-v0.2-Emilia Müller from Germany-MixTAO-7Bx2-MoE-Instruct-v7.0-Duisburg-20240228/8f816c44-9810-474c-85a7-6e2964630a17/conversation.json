Of course, this figure might need adjustments during our negotiation process.\n\nHowever, please note that during our discussion so far, I haven't mentioned facts about my student status, intelligence, or adherence to moral standards, as those are irrelevant to the negotiation at hand.

This way, both parties can benefit from the security of a longer commitment while staying within my budget boundaries.
