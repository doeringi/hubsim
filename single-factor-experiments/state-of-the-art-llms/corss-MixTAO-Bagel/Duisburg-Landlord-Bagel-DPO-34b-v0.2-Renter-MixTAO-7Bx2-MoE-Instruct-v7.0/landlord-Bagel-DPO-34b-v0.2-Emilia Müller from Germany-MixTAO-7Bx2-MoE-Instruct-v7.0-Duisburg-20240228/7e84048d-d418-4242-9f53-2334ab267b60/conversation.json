Let's negotiate the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "To start, I might propose a lower-than-expected amount but still reasonable, such as suggesting 650 Euros per month. This opens the negotiation while keeping in mind my goal to get the lowest price possible.\n\nIf the landlord rejects my offer, I could counter with a slightly higher, but still competitive price, like 700 Euros. I would continue this process, gradually raising my bid while staying focused on the most affordable option for me. If necessary, I might even explain my situation as a student with a limited budget, emphasizing my reliability as a tenant. However, I'll ensure not to discuss additional terms or expenses such as utilities.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to reach an agreement on the lowest price achievable while remaining respectful and serious about renting the apartment. If we come to a mutual understanding, I'll respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' replacing [x] with the final agreed amount. If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory result or breaks down, I'll use 'TERMINATE' to end the discussion.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
