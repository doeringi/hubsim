However, considering my student budget, I'm hoping to find something more affordable. Could we discuss the possibility of a lower rent, perhaps closer to the market average for a similar unit in this area?\n\nLandlord: Well, this is a newly built apartment in the city center, making it quite attractive for potential tenants. The current rent may not be as flexible as you'd like, but let me see if we can find a compromise.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: I appreciate your willingness to consider my situation. Based on my research, I've seen some comparable listings in the area at a slightly lower price point. If we could meet around 10% below your current offer, it would be a fair compromise for both of us.\n\nLandlord: I understand your position, but a 10% reduction is quite significant. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. How about if I lower the rent by 5%?\n\nMax M\u00fcller: While I'd prefer a larger reduction, a 5% decrease is more acceptable than the original offer. However, I'd still like to inquire if there's any room for a little more flexibility, perhaps in exchange for a longer lease term or paying a larger security deposit?\n\nLandlord: I'm open to discussing a longer lease term, but the security deposit would remain the standard amount due to company policy. Could we agree on a two-year lease in exchange for the reduced rent?\n\nMax M\u00fcller: I'm happy to commit to a two-year lease in order to secure a more favorable rent price. So, I agree to the price with a 5% reduction and a two-year lease term.\n\nTERMINATE (The negotiation has come to a successful conclusion with an agreement on the rental price and lease term.)", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
