Let's focus on the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering me as a potential tenant. To secure this apartment, I would like to propose negotiating the rental price as low as possible while respecting fair market conditions. Could you share the initial amount you had in mind?\n\nIn this scenario, Max M\u00fcller is a potential tenant trying to negotiate the lowest possible rental price for an apartment in Duisburg, Germany. He starts the conversation by acknowledging the invitation to see the property but immediately shifts the focus to the negotiation about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I always aim for the highest possible rental price. For this newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center of Duisburg, I am looking for a price that reflects its prime location and modern amenities. I would like to start with an amount of 1500 euros per month. Remember, our goal is to find a price that works for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective as a landlord, aiming for a competitive rental price. However, as a prospective tenant who values affordability and responsible budgeting, I would find it challenging to agree on a 1500 euros starting point. Could we consider a more moderate price considering the apartment's features but still taking into account my financial limitations?\n\nIn this response, Max M\u00fcller is trying to find a middle ground in the negotiation process, highlighting his perspective as a tenant while also acknowledging the landlord's need for a reasonable rental price. He suggests a more moderate price point in light of the apartment's features and his financial constraints.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I strive to find a balance between the property's value and the tenant's ability to pay. However, given the prime location and modern amenities of the apartment, I cannot go below 1200 euros per month.

Let's see if we can find a mutual agreement within this range.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for being open to a compromise and considering my financial situation. While 1200 euros per month is still a significant expense for me, I appreciate your efforts in finding common ground.

My goal as a landlord is to ensure a consistent and reliable income from the rent.
