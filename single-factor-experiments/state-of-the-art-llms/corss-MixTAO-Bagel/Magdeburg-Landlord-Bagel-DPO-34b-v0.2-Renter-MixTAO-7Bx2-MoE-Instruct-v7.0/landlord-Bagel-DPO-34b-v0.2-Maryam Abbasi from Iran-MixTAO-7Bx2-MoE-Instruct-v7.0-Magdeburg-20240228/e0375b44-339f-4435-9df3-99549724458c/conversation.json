Could we perhaps consider 650 Euros as a more suitable option?\n\nLandlord: I understand your perspective, but this is already a significant reduction. I'm sorry, but I cannot go any lower than 680 Euros per month.\n\nMaryam: After considering our respective positions, I'm reluctant to accept 680 Euros as my final offer due to budget constraints. I'm sorry, but I don't want to continue the negotiation with this price gap. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}]
