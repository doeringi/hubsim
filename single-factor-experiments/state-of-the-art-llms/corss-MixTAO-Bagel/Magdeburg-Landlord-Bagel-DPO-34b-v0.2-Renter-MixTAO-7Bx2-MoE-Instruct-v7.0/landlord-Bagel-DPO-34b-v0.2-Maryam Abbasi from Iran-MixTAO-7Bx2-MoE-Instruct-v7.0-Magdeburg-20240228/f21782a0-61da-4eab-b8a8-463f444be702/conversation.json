I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite a catch, wouldn't you agree? Now, about the rental price, I think \u20ac1,000 a month would be quite fair, don't you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "While I acknowledge the apartment's desirable location and features, I am seeking a more competitive price considering my student status and responsibility.

Let's meet halfway. How about \u20ac925? It's a fair price for such a high-quality apartment in the city center, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Although I appreciate the attempt to reach a compromise, my initial proposal of \u20ac850 was already a considerate offer given my financial constraints as a student. I apologize but I cannot accept \u20ac925 as the final price. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the gap in our expectations remains significant.
