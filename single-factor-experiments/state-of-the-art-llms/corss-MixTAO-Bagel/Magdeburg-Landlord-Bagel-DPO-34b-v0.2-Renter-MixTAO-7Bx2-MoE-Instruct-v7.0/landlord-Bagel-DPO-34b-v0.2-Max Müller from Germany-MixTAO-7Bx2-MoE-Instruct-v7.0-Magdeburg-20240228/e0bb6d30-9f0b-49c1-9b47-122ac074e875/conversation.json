I want to rent out my apartment for the highest price possible. If you are interested, it would be 1000 Euro per month. Remember, I'm not here to discuss anything but the rental price. So, if you agree to the price of 1000 Euro, I would say 'I agree to the price of [1000] Euro!' If you don't agree, please let me know and we can end the negotiation with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
