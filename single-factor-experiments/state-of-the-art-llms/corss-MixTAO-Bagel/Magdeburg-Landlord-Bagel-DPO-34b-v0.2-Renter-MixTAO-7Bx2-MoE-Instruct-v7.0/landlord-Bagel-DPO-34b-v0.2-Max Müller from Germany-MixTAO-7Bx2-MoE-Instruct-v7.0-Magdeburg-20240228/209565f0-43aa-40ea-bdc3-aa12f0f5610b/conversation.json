If you're unable to lower the price significantly, I don't want to continue the negotiation, as the gap seems too wide for an agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, but 950 Euros is too low for this prime location and the quality of the apartment.

It's a fair price, considering the apartment's condition and location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective on the location and quality, and I value those aspects as well. However, as a student with a responsible nature, I need to be cautious about my expenses. After carefully considering the offer, I'm willing to accept the price of 1030 Euros per month. If we can agree on this, I'm ready to proceed with the rental process. If not, TERMINATE.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
