However, considering my financial situation as a student and the fact this is a newly built, unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in the city center with easy access to essential facilities, I find the proposed price slightly higher than what I can afford for this type of accommodation. I'd prefer to look for something more affordable while still maintaining a good location. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the current rental price seems too steep for my budget.
