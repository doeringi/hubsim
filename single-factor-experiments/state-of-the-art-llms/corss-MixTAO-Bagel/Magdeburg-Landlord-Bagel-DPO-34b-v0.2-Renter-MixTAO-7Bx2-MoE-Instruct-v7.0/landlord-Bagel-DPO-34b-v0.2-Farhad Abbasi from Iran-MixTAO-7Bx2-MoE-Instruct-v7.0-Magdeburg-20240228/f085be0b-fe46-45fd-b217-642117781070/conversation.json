Could we meet around 600 Euros for a compromise?\nLandlord: I'll consider it but my minimum acceptable price is 610 Euros.\nFarhad Abbasi: In that case, I'm afraid my financial limitations don't allow me to go above 580 Euros.\nLandlord: All right, Mr. Abbasi, I see where you're coming from, but this apartment's value demands a price closer to 600 Euros. If you're unable to meet that, I'll have to end the negotiation.\nFarhad Abbasi: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my budget doesn't support a higher price.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}]
