[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

I'm sure you'll find my apartment to be quite appealing. Now, about the rental price, let's negotiate.

Could we possibly consider a reduction of around 10% from your initial offer?' I'm simulating the negotiation process while keeping in mind your opposite objective.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your point, but I must inform you that I am aiming for the highest price possible. I appreciate your interest in my apartment, but I cannot accept your proposal. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I am unwilling to reduce the price by 10%. Let's see if we can find a price that meets both our needs.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your clarification. As I am still striving to find the most affordable option, I'll have to reconsider my stance. However, I recognize your position as the landlord and understand your need for a higher rate. In this case, let's suspend the negotiation temporarily to rethink my approach. If a mutually agreeable price can be found, I will gladly resume discussions. TERMINATE (for now) but open for future conversation if necessary.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
