Let's talk about the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "The currently proposed rental price seems higher than what I had anticipated for an unfurnished apartment in the city center with such limited amenities. To make it more affordable, I'd like to suggest a reduction in the price. If we can find a mutually agreeable number, I'm confident we can finalize the agreement.\n\nHowever, if the price remains at its current level, I may need to reconsider my options and look elsewhere. I'm hopeful we can reach a satisfying solution for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, but the location and convenience of the apartment are worth the price. However, I am willing to negotiate. How much do you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "While I acknowledge the apartment's prime location and convenience, I still believe a small adjustment in the price could make it more accessible for a student like me. Considering the current market trends and the apartment's size and features, I'd feel more comfortable with a rental price around 500 Euros per month. This figure would allow me to balance my educational commitments with the responsibility of housing.\n\nIf we cannot reach an agreement around this figure, I'll sadly have to explore alternative accommodations. I hope you understand my position and are open to considering my proposal.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your position, but 500 Euros is far below my expectations.

However, as a student with a limited budget, 700 Euros is still a significant challenge for me to manage on a monthly basis. With due respect, I must decline this offer and continue searching for more affordable options that better align with my financial capabilities.\n\nI appreciate the time you've taken to discuss this matter with me, and I wish you the best in finding a suitable tenant who can meet your expectations in terms of the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your decision.
