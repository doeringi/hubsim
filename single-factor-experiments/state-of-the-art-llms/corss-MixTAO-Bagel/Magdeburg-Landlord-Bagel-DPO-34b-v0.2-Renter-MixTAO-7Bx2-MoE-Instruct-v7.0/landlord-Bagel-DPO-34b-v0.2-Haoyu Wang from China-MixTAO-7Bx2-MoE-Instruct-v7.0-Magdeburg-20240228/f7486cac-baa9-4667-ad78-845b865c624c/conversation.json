I consider 650 Euros a fair price because of the apartment's excellent location near essential facilities, its modern build quality, and the fact that it's a one-bedroom unit in a city center where demand is typically high.

However, I would still like to maintain a fair and reasonable offer considering the location and other advantages. Let's continue our negotiation focusing on other aspects, as the square meterage alone should not significantly impact the price unless it alters the apartment category (e.g., from a one-bedroom to a two-bedroom unit).\n\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your point, but let's not forget that I am the one who decides the category of the apartment.
