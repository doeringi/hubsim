Let's make it a fair one, shall we?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "So, Max, what do you think is a fair price for a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a good question, Max. I think a fair price would be 700 euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I see. Well, the apartment is indeed in a great location and is newly built. However, I think 700 euros is a bit high. How about we go with 750 euros instead? It's a nice round number and I'm sure we can make the place feel like home for you.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your proposal, Max.

Well, let's meet in the middle then. How about 712 euros? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "  That's a very generous offer, Max. But I must stick to my guns and ask for 700 euros. I hope you understand.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "   Of course, Max. I respect your determination. Alright, since you insist, I'll agree to 700 euros.
