Let's start the negotiation with a higher-than-usual price tag to squeeze every last cent out of you. I propose the monthly rent to be 1200 Euros. Max, if you find this acceptable, say 'I agree to the price of 1200 Euro!' otherwise, provide a reason for not continuing the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is too expensive for me. I was thinking of something around 700 Euros per month. It is an unfurnished apartment and the location is not that great. Therefore, I suggest this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because although the apartment is newly built and in the city center, I'm unwilling to consider the lower price due to my aggressive negotiating tactics. If you change your mind and want to discuss a higher price, feel free to reinitiate the conversation. As of now, TERMINATE.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
