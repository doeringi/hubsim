Due to its prime location and exceptional features, I have received numerous inquiries. Considering that, my initial thought for the monthly rent is 1500 Euros.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: That's quite high, I was expecting something in the range of 1200 to 1300 Euros, considering my budget and other available options.\n\nMe: I understand your concerns, Mr. M\u00fcller, but the demand is indeed high for such a central location and the apartment's condition. However, given your interest in this property, I might be able to make a slight concession, but keep in mind that it's still a sought-after area. How about 1450 Euros per month? This price is only marginally lower than my initial proposal but remains competitive in the local market.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: Let's see... I'll need to think about it. The apartment is lovely, but I'm not certain if I can afford 1450 Euros. I'll get back to you soon.\n\nMe: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm unwilling to lower the price any further for this highly sought-after apartment.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
