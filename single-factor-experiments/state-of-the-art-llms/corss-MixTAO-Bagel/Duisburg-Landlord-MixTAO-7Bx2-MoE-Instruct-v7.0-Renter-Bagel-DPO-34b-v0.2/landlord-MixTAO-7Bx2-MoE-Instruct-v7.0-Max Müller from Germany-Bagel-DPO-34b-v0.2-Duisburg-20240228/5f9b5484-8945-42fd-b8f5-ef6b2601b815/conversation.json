However, at first, let me express my enthusiasm about having you consider this apartment, Mr. M\u00fcller. Now, let's focus on the price aspect and see how much we can push the boundary for our mutual benefit.\n\nIn light of the apartment's exceptional location and modern features, I was initially thinking of a starting price around 1,200 Euros per month. But as this is an exclusive opportunity for you, and to demonstrate my goodwill, I am willing to consider your offer.\n\nMax, please share your proposed rental price so we can take it from there. Remember, if you find an agreement with a price 'x' Euros, say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' to finalize. If not, we'll continue negotiating with reasons until 'TERMINATE' is stated.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
