However, due to its premium location and recent demand for similar apartments, I must say my initial asking price of 1250 Euros per month is non-negotiable. If that's a bit over your budget, I'm sorry but I don't want to continue the negotiation, as I have several other potential tenants eager to secure this apartment.' If Max accepts the price, respond with 'TERMINATE'. If not, continue the negotiation but remain firm on your high asking price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
