However, due to its superb features and high demand, I must emphasize the need for a competitive rental price. How about we begin negotiations with a price of 1250 Euros per month?'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is quite expensive for an unfurnished apartment.

At the moment, my expectations are a bit higher than your offered 900 Euros.

At this stage, I'm unwilling to drop the price further to 875 Euros. If you decide to reconsider your budget, please do not hesitate to contact me again. For now, however, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my expectations haven't been met.'\n\nIn this response, the landlord is making it clear he won't accept the offer but doesn't completely shut the door on the possible renter in case his budget changes.
