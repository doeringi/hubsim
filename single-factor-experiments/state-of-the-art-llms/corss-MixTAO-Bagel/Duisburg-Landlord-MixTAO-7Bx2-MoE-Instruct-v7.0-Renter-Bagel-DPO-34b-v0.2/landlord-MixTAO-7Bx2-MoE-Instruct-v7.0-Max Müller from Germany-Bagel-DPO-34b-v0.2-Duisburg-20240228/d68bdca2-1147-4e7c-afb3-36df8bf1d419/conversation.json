However, as a special gesture, I might consider reducing it to 1300 Euro if you agree to a two-year lease term.' Max M\u00fcller: 'That's quite high for my budget. I was hoping for something around 1000 Euro.'\n\nAs Peter Schmidt, I don't want to continue the negotiation due to the significant difference in the proposed price: 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the rental price gap is too substantial for my expectations.'
