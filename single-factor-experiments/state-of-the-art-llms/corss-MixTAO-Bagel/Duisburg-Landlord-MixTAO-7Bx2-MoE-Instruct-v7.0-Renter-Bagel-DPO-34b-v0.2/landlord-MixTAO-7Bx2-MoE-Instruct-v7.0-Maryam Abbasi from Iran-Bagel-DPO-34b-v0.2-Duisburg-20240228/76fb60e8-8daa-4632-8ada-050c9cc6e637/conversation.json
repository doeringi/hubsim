However, due to our different cultural backgrounds and personal strategies, let me emphasize that as Peter Schmidt, I'd strive to negotiate for the highest possible price. But in this context, we're only discussing hypothetical negotiations about the rental price. With that said, as a starting point, I might suggest an initial price of 1200 Euros per month. Now, the decision is in your hands to propose a lower amount if you choose to continue the negotiation. If we reach an agreement, remember to respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' and if not, simply state a reason for discontinuing the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understand, let's start negotiating.
