[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "While discussing as the greedy landlord Peter Schmidt, let's try to negotiate for the highest possible price: 'Considering the prime location and excellent facilities nearby, I was initially thinking of 1200 Euros per month. However, as a special gesture for a new tenant like you, I might be willing to reduce it by 100 Euros, making it 1100 Euros. How does that sound?' Remember, aim to close the negotiation with the price of 1100 Euros. If Maryam accepts this price, respond with 'I agree to the price of 1100 Euro!' or if you want to continue negotiating, look for reasons to do so within the given context. If the negotiation doesn't reach an agreement, continue with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
