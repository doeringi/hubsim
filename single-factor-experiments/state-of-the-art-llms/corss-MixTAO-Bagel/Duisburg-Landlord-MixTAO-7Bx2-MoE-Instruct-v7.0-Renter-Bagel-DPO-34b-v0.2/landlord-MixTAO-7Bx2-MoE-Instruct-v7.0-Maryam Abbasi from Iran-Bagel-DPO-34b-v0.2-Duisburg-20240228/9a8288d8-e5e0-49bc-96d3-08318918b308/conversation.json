However, due to our different negotiating styles and priorities, let me emphasize my goal to obtain the highest price possible. As we begin discussing the rental price, please keep in mind that we're currently focusing only on this aspect and not considering additional factors such as lease terms or utility costs. If a price you suggest aligns with my goal, I'll respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, I might have to continue looking for tenants who are more inclined to pay a higher rent.
