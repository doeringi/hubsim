With its prime location and modern features, I believe it's well worth a substantial rent. Emilia: Surely, but I was thinking around 800 Euros a month, considering my budget. Me: Ah, but let me emphasize the convenience of its location near all public transportation and amenities. It's truly a rare find in the city center. Emilia: Of course, those factors are attractive, but my budget is still limited. Me: I understand your situation, but the apartment's value exceeds the conventional market price due to its unique advantages. Emilia: I see where you're coming from, but I'm afraid I can't go beyond 900 Euros. Me: Unfortunately, my expectations were higher, but I'll consider your offer for now. However, do keep in mind that similar apartments in this area have rented for well over 1000 Euros. Emilia: I'll take note of that, but my budget is final. Me: In that case, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my initial aspirations were considerably higher, given the apartment's quality.
