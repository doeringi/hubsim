However, I must emphasize the tremendous demand and my intention to secure the best rental terms possible. With this in mind, let me begin the negotiation at a considerably high price of 1250 Euros per month. Emilia, if you find this acceptable, I agree to the price of [1250] Euro! If not, please inform me of a lower price you'd consider, but remember my priority is maximizing my return on investment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Schmidt. Considering the location and the unfurnished state of the apartment, I believe that 900 Euros per month would be more reasonable. This price aligns with the market value and takes into account the costs of furnishing the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your proposal, Emilia, but as Peter Schmidt, I'm reluctant to accept a price below my initial offer due to the strong demand in the area and my need to protect my investment. I'd prefer to maintain the 1250 Euros as the rental price. If, however, you are unable to meet these terms, I must regretfully inform you that I don't want to continue the negotiation, because of this significant difference in our expectations.
