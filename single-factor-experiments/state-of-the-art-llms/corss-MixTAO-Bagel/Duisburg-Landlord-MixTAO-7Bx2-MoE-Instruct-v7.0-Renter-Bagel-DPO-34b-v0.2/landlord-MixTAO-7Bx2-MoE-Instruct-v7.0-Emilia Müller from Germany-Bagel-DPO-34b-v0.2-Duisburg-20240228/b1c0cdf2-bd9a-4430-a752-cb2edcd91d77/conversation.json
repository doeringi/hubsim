Considering that, I was initially thinking of setting the monthly rent at 1200 Euros. However, since you seem like a responsible tenant, I'll be willing to lower it a bit to 1150 Euros on the condition that you sign a two-year lease. What do you think about this offer? Emilia, if you don't find it acceptable or wish to continue negotiating, please let me know with a different rental price in mind.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is too high.
