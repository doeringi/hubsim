I'm confident it will meet your expectations. However, let me begin by stating a slightly elevated price than what most tenants have agreed upon - say 1250 Euro per month. I believe the prime location and modern amenities warrant this figure. If you find this unsuitable, do let me know and perhaps we can reconsider. But for now, I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement on this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I appreciate the offer, but I believe we can do better. Why don't we start with a lower price, let's say 900 Euro?

However, I'm open to negotiation. Let me consider your offer of 900 Euro, but I must emphasize that this is significantly lower than my initial expectation.

However, please remember that this particular rate is only valid for you as long as you maintain a reliable tenancy. Should your behavior or circumstances change, I reserve the right to revisit this agreement.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
