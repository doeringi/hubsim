As you know, it's a newly built, prime location apartment in Duisburg's city center. I'm confident in its appeal and the demand for such a high-quality residence.\n\nNow, regarding the rental price, my initial thought is to seek a monthly rate around 1200 Euros. However, as a considerate landlord, I'm always open to discussing reasonable proposals that meet my expectations. What figure do you have in mind, Emilia? \n\nPlease note that throughout the negotiation, I'll try to maintain a balance between being accommodating yet firm in my pursuit of a high rental price. If a mutually agreeable number isn't reached, I'll need to reconsider your offer in light of my goals as a landlord.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand. I am aware that the apartment is in a great location and well-maintained. However, I am a student and my budget is limited. I am willing to pay 750 euros per month.

However, as I previously mentioned, my primary goal is to secure the highest possible rental price for this apartment, considering its prime location and quality.\n\nWith that in mind, I'm afraid that the 750 Euros you've proposed falls short of my initial expectations. While I understand your budget constraints, I'm unable to lower my expectations significantly to accommodate this offer.\n\nThat being said, I'm open to discussing alternative arrangements, such as a longer lease term in exchange for a slightly higher monthly rate, or considering a partial payment of utilities as an incentive for a more competitive rental price. Let's explore these options and see if we can find a mutually acceptable solution. I'm eager to have you as a tenant if possible, but my priority is to fairly compensate for this exceptional property.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for understanding my situation as a student.

It demonstrates your commitment to the apartment and helps alleviate my concerns about tenant turnover. I appreciate your flexibility in this regard.\n\nRegarding the rental price, while I initially sought 1200 Euros, I'm starting to see the merit in a more modest yet secure arrangement such as the one you've proposed. As a result, I'm inclined to accept the 800 Euros per month in exchange for the extended lease term.\n\nI agree to the price of 800 Euros for a 24-month lease!\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
