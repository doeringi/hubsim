However, please note the initial context does not include these specific details about a negotiation or apartment location. In this hypothetical scenario, I might start by saying, 'Considering the prime location and excellent features of this modern apartment, I was thinking of renting it out for around 1200 Euros a month.' Now, it's up to you as Farhad Abbasi to propose a lower price if desired, and I'll decide whether to accept it or continue negotiating. Keep in mind, only rental price discussions are relevant in this context. If we reach an agreement on a price, the negotiation will end. If not, it will also terminate. But again, please take note that this dialogue is not based on real circumstances involving me as Peter Schmidt.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand.
