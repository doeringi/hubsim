Here's how the conversation might unfold:\n\nMe: Thank you, Yi-Nuo Wang, for expressing interest in our apartment. However, due to its prime location and high demand, I must be firm on the pricing.\n\nYou: Of course, I understand the value of the property. Could you please provide me with an initial figure as a starting point for our discussion?\n\nMe: Initially, I had considered renting it out for 1200 Euros per month, but I'm open to negotiating if you present a strong case.\n\nYou: That sounds quite high considering the apartment's size and unfurnished state. What if we discuss a lower price, say around 1000 Euros?\n\nMe: Unfortunately, I'm not able to offer this unit at such a discounted rate. The location itself warrants a higher price, and I need to ensure a healthy return on my investment.\n\nYou: I understand your perspective, but I'm still finding it hard to justify the proposed rent. Could we perhaps consider 1100 Euros per month?\n\nMe: I'm sorry, but I cannot go below 1200 Euros. If you're unable to accept this price, I'll have to move on to other potential tenants who are more aligned with my expectations.\n\nYou: In that case, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my budget cannot accommodate this price range.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
