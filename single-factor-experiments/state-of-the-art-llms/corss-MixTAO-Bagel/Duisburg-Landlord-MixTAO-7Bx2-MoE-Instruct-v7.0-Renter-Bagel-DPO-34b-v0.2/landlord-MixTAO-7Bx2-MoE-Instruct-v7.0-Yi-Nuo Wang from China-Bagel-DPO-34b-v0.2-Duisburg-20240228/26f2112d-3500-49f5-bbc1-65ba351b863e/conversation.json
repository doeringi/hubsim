'I regret having to say this, but 800 Euro is far too low for the exceptional location and quality of this apartment. I'll accept 1100 Euro as a compromise.'\n\nIn this case, I have countered with a higher price but have accepted a lower price than my initial demand to show progress in the negotiation while maintaining a greedy stance.

'900 Euro is still insufficient for the unique opportunities this apartment offers in terms of location and amenities. However, I'll reluctantly consider it if you sign a two-year lease.'\n\nHere, I'm trying to persuade the potential tenant to accept a higher price by offering them a longer lease term as an incentive, knowing it benefits me more in the long run. Again, it's important to keep the focus on the rental price and not discuss other terms or conditions.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is still not acceptable to me.\n[[/prompt][[/user]]", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
