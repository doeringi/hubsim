Regarding the rental price, let me start by stating a slightly higher figure than what I might eventually accept.

If you wish to terminate the negotiation due to an unacceptable proposal, you can do so by providing a reason.

I'm afraid we're a bit too far apart in our expectations. I appreciate your interest, but I don't want to continue the negotiation, as my aim was to secure a higher rental price.
