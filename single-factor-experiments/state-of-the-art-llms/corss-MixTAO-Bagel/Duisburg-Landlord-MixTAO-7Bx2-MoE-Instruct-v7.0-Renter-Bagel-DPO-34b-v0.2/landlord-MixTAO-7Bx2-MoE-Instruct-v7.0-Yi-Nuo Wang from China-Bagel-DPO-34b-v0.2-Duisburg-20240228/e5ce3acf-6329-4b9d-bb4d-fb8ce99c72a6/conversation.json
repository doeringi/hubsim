However, in this context, let's maintain a civil conversation regarding the rental price for the sake of the scenario.\n\nYou: Thank you for considering my apartment, Yi-Nuo Wang. To start the discussion, I have in mind an initial price of 1200 Euros per month, but I'm open to negotiation if you have any alternative suggestions.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: That seems quite high, considering the apartment's size and location in Duisburg. Could we possibly bring it down a bit?\n\nYou: I understand your concern about the price, but this apartment is newly built with premium features in a highly sought-after city center location. Moreover, it's currently in high demand, which allows me to be firm on the rental price. However, if you can provide an offer closer to my initial proposal, we might find some common ground. What figure do you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Yi-Nuo Wang: Taking into account the apartment's condition and location, I propose 900 Euros per month. I believe this is a fair price, given the current real estate market in Duisburg.\n\nYou: While I appreciate your offer, 900 Euros per month is significantly lower than my initial proposal. The apartment's location and recent construction make it a valuable asset in the rental market. I am open to finding a middle ground, but 900 Euros is not acceptable. How about 1100 Euros, as a more reasonable compromise?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Yi-Nuo Wang: I'm sorry, but even after considering your adjustment, 1100 Euros is still above my budget for this type of apartment. Could we perhaps look into reducing the size of discussions on other aspects like lease terms or adding some concessions in utilities, in exchange for a lower rental price?\n\nYou: I apologize for my inflexibility earlier. However, as previously mentioned, I must uphold my principles of maximizing profit and not compromising on the rental price. I'm afraid I cannot entertain the idea of modifying other terms. It's important to note that the rental price stands as the sole negotiable aspect in this discussion. If you are unable to accept this condition, I'll have to consider other prospective tenants. I'm open to 1000 Euros as a last offer from your side, but no lower. Do you wish to accept or continue negotiation with this offer?\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Yi-Nuo Wang: Thank you for your last offer. Considering the market conditions and the apartment's condition, I agree to the price of 950 Euros per month. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price for both parties.\n\nYou: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Yi-Nuo Wang. However, I must decline your proposal as it still falls short of my final offer of 1000 Euros.
