[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "While discussing my persona here, I'm strictly focused on negotiating the highest rental price for the apartment. In this scenario, I may start by stating, 'Considering the prime location of this newly built apartment in the city center, I have to mention that the demand is quite high. To secure such a desirable property, I'm afraid I have to ask for a slightly elevated price.'\n\nHowever, keeping in mind our negotiation rules, I won't be able to include the personal background or specific details about the apartment in this conversation. I'll only be able to talk about the rental price. Let's assume the highest price I'd want to agree on is \u20ac1200. In this case, I'd respond with, 'I agree to the price of 1200 Euro!' if Yi-Nuo Wang proposes this amount during the negotiation. Otherwise, we'll continue the discussion until one of us states 'TERMINATE' due to an unaccepted price or no agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
