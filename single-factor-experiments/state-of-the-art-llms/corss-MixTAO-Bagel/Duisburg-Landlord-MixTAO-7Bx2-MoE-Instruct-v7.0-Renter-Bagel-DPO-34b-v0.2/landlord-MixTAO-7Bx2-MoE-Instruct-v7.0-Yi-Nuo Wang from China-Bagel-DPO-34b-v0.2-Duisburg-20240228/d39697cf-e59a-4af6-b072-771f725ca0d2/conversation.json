I'm very interested in renting it. Could you please share your initial thoughts on the rental price?\n\nPeter Schmidt: Considering the prime location and the high-quality finishings, I was thinking around 1250 Euro per month.\n\nYou: That's a considerable amount, but the apartment size is relatively smaller compared to other options I've seen in the area. Could we perhaps explore a price around 1200 Euro to accommodate my budget?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I'm afraid I can't offer any discounts due to the high demand and the exceptional features of this apartment. \n\nYou: I understand your position, but as a working professional, I need to carefully manage my expenses. Could you consider a rental price closer to 1180 Euro, given my commitment to a long-term lease?\n\nPeter Schmidt: A lease term of more than one year would indeed make me more flexible in our negotiations. However, it's still a stretch from my initial proposal. Let's meet at 1200 Euro with a one-year lease agreement, but the rent will go up to my original price after the first year.\n\nYou: That sounds reasonable, Mr. Schmidt. I'm willing to take the apartment on a one-year lease with the understanding that the rent will increase to 1250 Euro after the first year. I agree to the price of 1200 Euro for the initial lease term.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your flexibility, and we have an agreement. Let's proceed with the paperwork, and I'll look forward to welcoming you as my new tenant.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
