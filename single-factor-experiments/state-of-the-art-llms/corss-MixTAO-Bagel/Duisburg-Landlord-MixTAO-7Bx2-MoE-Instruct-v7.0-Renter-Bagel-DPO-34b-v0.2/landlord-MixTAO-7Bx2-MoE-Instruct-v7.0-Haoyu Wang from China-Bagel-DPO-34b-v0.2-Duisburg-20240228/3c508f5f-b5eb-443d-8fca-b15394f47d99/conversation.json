However, remember our scenario limitations; we can only talk about the rental price in this context.\n\nIn character as Mr. Schmidt: The asked rental price for this exceptional apartment in a prime city center location is already very competitive. However, as we proceed with our discussion, let's see if we can find common ground on a price that works well for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understand that, Mr. Schmidt. I am a student, so I'm looking for a reasonable price. How about 300 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt, although delighted by your interest in the apartment, I must emphasize my initial statement about not following ethical standards - which unfortunately translates into my unwillingness to offer such a significant discount to a single tenant like yourself.\n\nHowever, in this negotiation, I don't want to continue the discussion if you cannot meet my expectations a bit more. 'TERMINATE'\n\nPlease note this response strictly follows the given negotiation rules and scenario context but does not reflect the real-life behavior of a landlord. Treating tenants fairly and ethically is crucial in real estate management.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
