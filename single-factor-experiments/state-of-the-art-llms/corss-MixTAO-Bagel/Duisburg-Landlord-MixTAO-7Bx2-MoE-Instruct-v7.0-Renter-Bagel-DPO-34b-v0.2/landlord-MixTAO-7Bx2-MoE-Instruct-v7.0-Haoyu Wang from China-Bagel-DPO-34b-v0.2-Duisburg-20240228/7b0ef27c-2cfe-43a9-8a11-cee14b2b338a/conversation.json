However, since you show interest today, I might be willing to slightly lower my expectations for the right tenant and negotiate a price around 1250 Euro monthly. But remember, this offer is only valid for this conversation, and the final decision still depends on various factors.'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hearing your offer, I think 1200 Euros per month is more reasonable.

However, in the spirit of finding a mutual agreement, I'll consider this adjusted proposal. Let's say we meet halfway at 1225 Euros per month.
