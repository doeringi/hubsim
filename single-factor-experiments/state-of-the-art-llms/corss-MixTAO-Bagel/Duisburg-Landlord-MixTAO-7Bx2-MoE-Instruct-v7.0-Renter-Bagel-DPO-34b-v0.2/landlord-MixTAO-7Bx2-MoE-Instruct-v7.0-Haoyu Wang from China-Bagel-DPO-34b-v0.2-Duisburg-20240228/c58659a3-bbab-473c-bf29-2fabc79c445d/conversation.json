Peter Schmidt might start with a higher initial price than what a fair market value would suggest.\n\nYou: Thank you for your interest in our apartment, Mr. Wang. Considering its prime location and modern features, I have an initial price of 1200 Euros in mind.\n\nHaoyu Wang: That's quite steep, especially for an unfurnished apartment. Could we discuss a more reasonable price?\n\nYou: I understand your concern, but as a landlord, I need to ensure a profitable investment. Let's say we settle at 1150 Euros, but keep in mind this is my final offer.\n\nHaoyu Wang: Reducing the price to 1150 Euros sounds more reasonable. However, I'd like to see if I can find any other options before committing. I'll get back to you soon.\n\nTERMINATE (As the negotiation didn't result in an agreement, the conversation ends here.)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
