The apartment is located in the heart of Duisburg, offering easy access to all amenities. Given its prime location and modern features, I believe a fair rental price would be 750 Euro per month.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: That's quite expensive, Herr Schmidt. I was hoping for a lower rent, maybe around 600 Euro.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand, Herr Abbasi. However, the apartment's location and quality justify the higher price. To make it more appealing, I could offer a small discount if you're willing to sign a longer lease, say 18 months.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: Let me think about it. What about 650 Euro per month, and I'll sign a one-year lease?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, but the apartment is worth more than that. How about we meet halfway at 700 Euro per month, and you can have a longer lease of 18 months?\n\nFarhad Abbasi: That's still higher than my budget, Herr Schmidt. Is there any chance you can lower the rent further? I'm afraid I'll have to look for another apartment if we can't reach a compromise.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concerns, Herr Abbasi. Given your enthusiasm for the apartment, I'm willing to consider a final offer of 675 Euro per month with a 12-month lease. This is my best offer, taking into account your budget and the apartment's value.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: Thank you for considering my situation, Herr Schmidt. I agree to the price of 675 Euro per month.\nPeter Schmidt: Excellent! We have reached an agreement. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
