The city center location and convenient facilities make it quite special. I believe a fair monthly rent for this apartment would be 1,200 Euros.\n\nFarhad: That's quite high, Mr. Schmidt. Can we negotiate the rental price?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand, Farhad. However, this is a newly built apartment with all the modern amenities. Considering its prime location, 1,200 Euros is actually reasonable. Would you be willing to increase your offer?\n\nFarhad: I appreciate the quality of the apartment, but my budget is limited. How about 1,000 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: Hmmm, 1,000 Euros is lower than what I had in mind. But, I'm open to discussing the possibility. Would you be willing to commit to a longer lease term, say 2 years, if I lower the rental price to 1,100 Euros?\n\nFarhad: I see. I'm not sure if I can commit to a 2-year lease, but I can commit to a 1-year lease. Can we meet somewhere in the middle and settle on 1,050 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: That's still lower than my initial offer, Farhad. However, given your commitment to a 1-year lease, I'm willing to consider 1,100 Euros per month.\n\nFarhad: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Mr. Schmidt. But, I'm afraid 1,100 Euros is still beyond my budget. Can we try 1,075 Euros per month? It's a compromise between our initial offers.\n\nPeter Schmidt: Alright, Farhad. I agree to the price of 1,075 Euros per month. We have reached a compromise.\n\nFarhad: Great! Thank you for your flexibility, Mr. Schmidt. I'm excited to rent this apartment.\n\nPeter Schmidt: My pleasure, Farhad. I'm glad we could reach a mutually beneficial agreement. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
