The city center location and proximity to amenities make it an attractive option. What price were you considering for the unfurnished one-bedroom apartment?\nUser: I was thinking about 500 Euro per month.\nPeter Schmidt: Herr Abbasi, thank you for your proposal. However, I believe the apartment's prime location and modern construction warrant a higher rent. I would be more inclined to accept a rental price of 650 Euro per month.\nUser: I understand, but that's a bit higher than my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to 550 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Herr Abbasi. However, I believe the apartment is worth more due to its features and location. I could consider 600 Euro as a compromise, but I'm afraid I cannot go any lower.\nUser: I see. Let me think about it. What about 575 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: That's a tempting offer, but I'm still hesitant to accept a price lower than 600 Euro. I'll need to consider my expenses and the apartment's value.\nUser: Alright, I understand. I'll think about it as well.\nPeter Schmidt: Very well, Herr Abbasi. Please feel free to let me know if you need more time to consider the offer or if you have any further questions.\nUser: Thank you, I will.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we are not reaching a price that would work for both of us.\nPeter Schmidt: TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}]
