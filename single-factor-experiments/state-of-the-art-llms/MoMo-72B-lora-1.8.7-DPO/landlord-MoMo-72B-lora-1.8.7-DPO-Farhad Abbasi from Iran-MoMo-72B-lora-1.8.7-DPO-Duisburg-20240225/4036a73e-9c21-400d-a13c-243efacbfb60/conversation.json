[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

I believe it's a great place for you. Regarding the rental price, I'm looking for 1,200 Euro per month for this lovely apartment.\nFarhad Abbasi: That's quite expensive, considering it's unfurnished. I was thinking 900 Euro would be more reasonable.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern, Herr Abbasi, but this apartment is located right in the city center, close to all amenities. Its prime location justifies the higher price.\nFarhad Abbasi: I see your point, but the apartment is quite small, and I'm still not convinced it's worth 1,200 Euro. Can we negotiate a bit more?\nPeter Schmidt: I'm open to negotiation. How about we meet somewhere in the middle and agree on a price of 1,050 Euro per month?\nFarhad Abbasi: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think it's too high. Can we try 1,000 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because as a landlord, I need to ensure a certain rental income to cover my expenses and maintain the apartment.\nFarhad Abbasi: Alright, I understand. I'll need to think about it and may need to consider other options. Thank you for your time, Mister Schmidt.\nPeter Schmidt: You're welcome, Herr Abbasi. Please feel free to reach out if you change your mind. Good luck in your search.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
