Thank you for your interest in my apartment. I believe it's a highly desirable location due to its proximity to various facilities. How much do you think would be a suitable rental price for this 50 square meter apartment in the city center?\nFarhad Abbasi: I think a fair price would be 600 Euro per month.\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you for your proposal, Herr Abbasi. However, I believe the apartment's location and quality warrant a higher price. What about a monthly rent of 800 Euros?\nFarhad Abbasi: That's a bit higher than I had in mind. How about we compromise at 700 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, Herr Abbasi. However, I'm still inclined to ask for 750 Euros per month, given the apartment's advantages and the current market rates.\nFarhad Abbasi: I understand your perspective, but I'm not sure if I can afford more than 700 Euros. Is there any chance we could negotiate further?\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point, Herr Abbasi. As a small concession, I'm willing to lower the rent to 725 Euros per month. This price still reflects the apartment's value and location without compromising too much.\nFarhad Abbasi: Thank you for considering my concerns, Peter. I think 725 Euros is acceptable for both of us. I agree to the price of 725 Euro.\nPeter Schmidt: I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Herr Abbasi.
