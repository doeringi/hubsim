Yes, let's discuss the rental price. This is a prime location, close to everything you might need. What price were you thinking?\n(Starting negotiation)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Danke, Herr Schmidt. I appreciate the warm welcome. I understand the apartment's convenient location, but as a student, my budget is quite limited. I was thinking of something around 450 Euros per month.\nHerr Schmidt: 450 Euros, huh? The usual rate for such an apartment is 650 Euros. However, I understand your situation as a student. How about we compromise at 550 Euros?\n(Continuing negotiation)\nFarhad Abbasi: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Herr Schmidt. However, 550 Euros is still slightly beyond my means. Would it be possible to bring the price down to 480 Euros? It's a fair offer considering my limited budget, and I promise to take good care of the apartment.\nHerr Schmidt: I see your point, Farhad. I really want to find a responsible tenant like you. Let's meet halfway at 515 Euros. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the property.\nFarhad Abbasi: Thank you, Herr Schmidt, for considering my situation. However, 515 Euros is still higher than my budget. What if I agree to a one-year lease and pay the rent on time every month? Would you consider lowering the price to 500 Euros?\nHerr Schmidt: Alright, Farhad. I appreciate your commitment to the lease and timely payments. I'll agree to 500 Euros per month, but I expect you to keep the apartment clean and well-maintained.\nFarhad Abbasi: Absolutely, Herr Schmidt. I'll take good care of the apartment. Thank you for understanding my situation and adjusting the rental price accordingly. I agree to the price of 500 Euros.\nHerr Schmidt: Great! I'm glad we could come to an agreement.
