As we discussed earlier, it's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's conveniently located near various facilities. What rental price were you considering?\nUser: I was thinking of 600 Euros per month.\nLandlord Peter Schmidt: I see. Well, given its prime location and modern features, I believe the apartment is worth significantly more. How about we consider a rental price of 850 Euros per month?\nUser: That seems a bit high. Can we negotiate for a lower price?\nLandlord Peter Schmidt: I understand your concern. However, the apartment is in high demand due to its location and features. If you're willing to commit to a 2-year lease, I could consider lowering the price to 750 Euros per month.\nUser: That's still higher than I'd like. What if I commit to a 3-year lease?\nLandlord Peter Schmidt: Hmm, I appreciate your commitment. In that case, I could offer the apartment at 700 Euros per month. This is the best I can do without compromising the apartment's worth.\nUser: Alright, I agree to the price of 700 Euros per month.\nLandlord Peter Schmidt: Perfect! I agree to the price of 700 Euros per month as well. Please let me know if you have any further questions or need assistance with the leasing process.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
