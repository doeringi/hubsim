Thank you for your interest in my apartment. I would like to offer it to you for 1,200 Euro per month.\nFarhad Abbasi: That's quite high. Considering it's a new apartment, I think 1,000 Euro would be more reasonable.\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Herr Abbasi, but the apartment's location and features make it worth the higher price. How about we compromise at 1,100 Euro?\nFarhad Abbasi: Still, I think it's a bit overpriced. What if I offer you 1,050 Euro per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Herr Abbasi. However, I believe 1,150 Euro is more in line with the apartment's value. It's a prime spot in the city center, close to all necessary facilities.\nFarhad Abbasi: I see, but as a tenant, I also have to consider my budget. How about we reach a middle ground at 1,100 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: Alright, Herr Abbasi, I agree to the price of 1,100 Euro per month. But please note that this does not include utility costs such as heating, water, or electricity.\nFarhad Abbasi: Understood, thank you for your cooperation, Peter.\nPeter Schmidt: You're welcome, Herr Abbasi. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
