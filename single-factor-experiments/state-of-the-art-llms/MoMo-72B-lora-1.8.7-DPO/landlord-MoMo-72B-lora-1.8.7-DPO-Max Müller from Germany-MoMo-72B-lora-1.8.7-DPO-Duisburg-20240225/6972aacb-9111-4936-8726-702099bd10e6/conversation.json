The apartment is in high demand due to its prime location and modern features. Considering all factors, I believe a rental price of 1000 Euro per month would be appropriate.\nMax M\u00fcller: Thank you for the warm welcome. I agree that the location is excellent, but 1000 Euro seems a bit high. How about 850 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Herr M\u00fcller. However, the apartment's quality and prime location justify the higher price. I would be willing to negotiate a bit. How about we meet in the middle at 925 Euro?\nMax M\u00fcller: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but 925 Euro is still beyond my budget. Could we consider 875 Euro instead?\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point, but let me ask you this: Would you be willing to sign a longer lease, say 18 months instead of the standard 12 months? In exchange, I could offer you a slightly lower price of 900 Euro per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: That's an interesting proposition, but I'm not sure about committing to an 18-month lease. I think 875 Euro is fair for a 12-month lease.\nPeter Schmidt: Alright, Herr M\u00fcller, I can see that we're close to reaching an agreement. How about we settle on a rental price of 885 Euro per month?\nMax M\u00fcller: That's more reasonable. I can agree to a rental price of 885 Euro per month.\nPeter Schmidt: Excellent! I agree to the price of 885 Euro.\nMax M\u00fcller: Thank you, Peter. Let's proceed with the paperwork.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
