[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

Now, regarding the rental price, this is a newly built apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities. I believe a fair starting point would be 1,200 Euros per month.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: 1,200 Euros seems a bit high. I was thinking more around 1,000 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: 1,000 Euros, huh? Well, Max, I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid that doesn't cover the apartment's value and its prime location. How about we meet halfway at 1,100 Euros?\n\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, 1,100 Euros is still a bit high for me. Can you offer any discounts or incentives to make the price more reasonable?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your interest, Max. However, this apartment is in high demand due to its prime location and quality. The best I can do is offer an extra week's notice before entering the apartment for any maintenance or inspections.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: That's thoughtful, but it's still not enough to make the price work for me. How about we try 1,050 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: 1,050 Euros, huh? Let me think about it. I appreciate your persistence, Max. Alright, I agree to the price of 1,050 Euros per month.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: Great! I'm glad we could reach an agreement. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
