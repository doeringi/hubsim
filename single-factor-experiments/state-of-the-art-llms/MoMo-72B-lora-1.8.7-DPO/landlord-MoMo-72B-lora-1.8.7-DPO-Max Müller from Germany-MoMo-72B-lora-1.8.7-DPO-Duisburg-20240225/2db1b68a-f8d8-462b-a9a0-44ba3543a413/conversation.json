As you know, this newly built 50 sqm one-bedroom apartment is in a prime location in the city center. It offers easy access to all essential amenities. I am looking to rent it out for the highest price possible.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: Yes, it's quite convenient for me. I was thinking of offering 800 Euros per month for the rent.\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you for your proposal, Max. However, the apartment is worth more than 800 Euros due to its prime location and modern features. I believe a rental price of 1,000 Euros per month would be more appropriate.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: Wow, that's quite high. How about we meet in the middle and settle for 900 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your attempt to negotiate, Max. However, the apartment's value is still higher than 900 Euros. I would be willing to consider a price of 950 Euros per month, taking into account your interest and the fact that it's a newly built apartment.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: Hmm, I understand your perspective. But 950 Euros is still a bit too much for me. What if I pay a higher deposit upfront or offer a longer lease term?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Max, but my focus is on the rental price. I am willing to consider the 950 Euros per month as a starting point for our negotiation. Let's keep discussing and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, let's say I can increase my offer to 925 Euros. Is that a fair compromise?\nPeter Schmidt: I see that you are trying to reach a compromise, Max. However, the apartment's value is still higher than 925 Euros. At this point, I would need to decline your offer.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: I see. Well, thank you for your time and the opportunity to view the apartment, Peter. I think we've reached the end of our negotiation.\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you, Max. It was a pleasure discussing the rental price with you. I hope you find the right apartment for your needs.
