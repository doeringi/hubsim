As for the rental price, it's a newly built apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities. It's a desirable location, so I believe a monthly rent of 1,200 Euros would be appropriate.\nMax M\u00fcller: That's a bit higher than I expected. What about 1,000 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: 1,000 Euros is still below my initial expectations. However, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at 1,100 Euros?\nMax M\u00fcller: I appreciate your flexibility, but 1,100 Euros is still higher than my budget. Can we negotiate further?\nPeter Schmidt: I see. Let me reconsider. What if I offer a slightly reduced price of 1,050 Euros, taking the apartment's proximity to amenities into account? This is already pushing my limits.\nMax M\u00fcller: I understand, but I'm not comfortable with that price. What if I offer 950 Euros, considering it's unfurnished?\nPeter Schmidt: 950 Euros is quite low. I can't accept that, but I don't want to lose a potential tenant. How about we compromise at 1,000 Euros, and I'll include a small welcome gift for you as a gesture of goodwill?\nMax M\u00fcller: That sounds fair enough. I agree to the price of 1,000 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: Great! I agree to the price of 1,000 Euros. Let's proceed with the paperwork. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
