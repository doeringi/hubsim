What do you think, Herr M\u00fcller?\n</SYS>\nAssistant: I appreciate your offer, but as a student, my budget is quite limited. I would prefer a lower rental price, if possible. Could we discuss a lower amount, perhaps around 650 Euros?\n</SYS>\nHuman: I understand your concern, Herr M\u00fcller. Let's compromise and settle at 700 Euros per month. It's a reasonable price for a newly built apartment in the city center.\n</SYS>\nAssistant: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think 650 Euros would be more suitable for my budget. Is there any chance we can meet in the middle at 675 Euros?\n</SYS>\nHuman: Alright, Herr M\u00fcller, I see your point. I will agree to a rental price of 675 Euros per month. I believe this is a fair deal for both parties.\n</SYS>\nAssistant: I agree to the price of 675 Euros!\n</SYS>\nHuman: Great, Herr M\u00fcller. It seems like we have reached a mutual agreement. I am glad we could find a suitable solution for you.\n</SYS>\nAssistant: TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
