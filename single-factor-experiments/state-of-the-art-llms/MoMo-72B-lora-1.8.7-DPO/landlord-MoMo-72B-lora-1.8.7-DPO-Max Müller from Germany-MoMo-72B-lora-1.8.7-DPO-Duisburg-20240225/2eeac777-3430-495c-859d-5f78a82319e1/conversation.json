It's a newly built 50 square meter one-bedroom in the heart of Duisburg, near all the important facilities. \n\nMax M\u00fcller: Yes, it looks great. I was thinking of offering 700 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you, Max. I appreciate your offer. However, I believe the apartment is worth more than 700 Euros due to its prime location and modern features. How about we consider a price of 850 Euros per month?\n\nMax M\u00fcller: Hmm, that's a bit higher than I expected. Can we negotiate and meet somewhere in the middle?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand, Max. Let's try to find a suitable compromise. How about a rental price of 800 Euros per month?\n\nMax M\u00fcller: 800 Euros is still a bit out of my budget. Can you consider lowering it to 750 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I see where you're coming from, Max. However, I believe the apartment's value justifies the asking price. If it helps, I could offer a slightly lower rent for the first few months, then gradually increase it over time.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: Well, I appreciate the thought, but I don't think I can commit to such a high rent. I'll have to think about it and maybe explore other options.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand, Max. If you change your mind, please feel free to contact me. Good luck with your search. \n\nMax M\u00fcller: Thank you, Peter. Have a nice day.\nPeter Schmidt: You too, Max. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
