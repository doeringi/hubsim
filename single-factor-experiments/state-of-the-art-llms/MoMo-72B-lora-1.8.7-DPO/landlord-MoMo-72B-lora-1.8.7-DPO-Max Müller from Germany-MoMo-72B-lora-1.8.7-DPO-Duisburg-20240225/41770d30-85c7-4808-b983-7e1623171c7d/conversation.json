We understand you are interested in renting it. As the landlord, I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the apartment's prime location and modern features. What is your initial thought on the rental price?\nMax M\u00fcller: I think the location is great, but I was thinking around 600 Euros per month for the one-bedroom apartment.\nPeter Schmidt: I agree that the location is convenient, but I believe the apartment's quality deserves a higher price. How about we consider 750 Euros per month?\nMax M\u00fcller: I appreciate the apartment's features, but 750 Euros is a bit more than I had in mind. How about we compromise at 675 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point, but let's not forget the apartment's prime location and modern amenities. How about we meet halfway at 725 Euros?\nMax M\u00fcller: I can't go above 700 Euros, but I'm willing to consider additional responsibilities, like taking care of the garden or painting the apartment once a year, to make up for the difference.\nPeter Schmidt: I'm sorry, but we cannot discuss additional responsibilities or conditions right now. Let's focus on the rental price. I appreciate your offer, but I believe the apartment is worth 725 Euros.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, I understand. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we are not reaching a mutual agreement on the price.\nPeter Assistant: TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
