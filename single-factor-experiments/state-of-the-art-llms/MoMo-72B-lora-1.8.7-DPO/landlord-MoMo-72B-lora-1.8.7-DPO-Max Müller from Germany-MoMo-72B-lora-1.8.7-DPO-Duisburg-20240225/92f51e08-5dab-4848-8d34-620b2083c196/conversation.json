As for the rental price, I believe this prime location in the city center, combined with the apartment's modern features, makes it worth [2000] Euro per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: That's quite steep, Mr. Schmidt. Considering it's a 50 square meter apartment, I think [1500] Euro would be more reasonable.\nPeter Schmidt: While I appreciate your perspective, Herr M\u00fcller, I have to consider the apartment's advantages, such as its proximity to public transportation and essential facilities. I believe [1800] Euro is a fair compromise.\nMax M\u00fcller: I understand, but [1600] Euro would be more in line with my budget. Are there any additional costs for utilities or maintenance?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your interest, but I'm afraid I can't accept [1600] Euro. Keep in mind that the apartment is newly built and unfurnished, which adds to its value. I'll consider [1750] Euro as my final offer.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, Mr. Schmidt, I'll consider [1700] Euro. That seems like a reasonable price for both of us.\nPeter Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe the apartment's value is higher than [1700] Euro. However, if you change your mind, feel free to contact me.\nMax M\u00fcller: Thank you for your time, Mr. Schmidt. I'll think about it.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
