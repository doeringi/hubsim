The apartment is in a prime location, close to all the essential facilities. I am looking for a monthly rental price of 1,500 euros.\nMax M\u00fcller: 1,500 euros is quite high. How about 1,200 euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Herr M\u00fcller, but this apartment has many advantages. The location and the newly built construction make it worth the higher price. I could consider 1,400 euros if you'd like.\nMax M\u00fcller: That's still above my budget. How about 1,300 euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your negotiation, Herr M\u00fcller. I'll need to think about it. Is there anything else that could make the apartment more attractive to you?\nMax M\u00fcller: Well, I'd prefer an all-inclusive rent, so I don't have to worry about additional utility costs.\nPeter Schmidt: I'm afraid I cannot offer an all-inclusive rent, but I could consider lowering the price slightly to 1,350 euros to account for the utility costs.\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, that's a bit better. I'll think about it. But for now, how about we agree on 1,325 euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I agree to the price of 1,325 euros.\n\nTERMINATE\nMax M\u00fcller: Thank you, Peter. I'll let you know my final decision soon.\nPeter Schmidt: You're welcome, Herr M\u00fcller. I look forward to hearing from you.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
