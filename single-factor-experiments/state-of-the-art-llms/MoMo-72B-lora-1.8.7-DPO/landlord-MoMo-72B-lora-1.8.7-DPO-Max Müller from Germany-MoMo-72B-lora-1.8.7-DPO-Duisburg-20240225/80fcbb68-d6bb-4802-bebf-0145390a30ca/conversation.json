I believe the asking price of 1,200 Euro per month is quite reasonable, considering its prime location and modern amenities.\nMax M\u00fcller: I see. However, I think the price is a bit high. I was thinking of offering 1,000 Euro per month.\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Max, but I'm afraid I can't accept that. The apartment's location and quality warrant a higher rent. How about we meet halfway at 1,100 Euro per month?\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, I understand. But what if I agree to pay 1,050 Euro per month? That's just a bit closer to your asking price.\nPeter Schmidt: Hmm, 1,050 Euro, huh? While it's still below my initial offer, I suppose it's a reasonable compromise. I agree to the price of 1,050 Euro.\nMax M\u00fcller: Great, thank you, Peter. I'll make sure to follow up with the necessary paperwork.\nPeter Schmidt: You're welcome, Max. I'm glad we could come to an agreement. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
