The apartment is in a prime location, and given its features, I think a monthly rent of 1,200 Euros would be suitable.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: That's a bit high, don't you think? How about 1,000 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Herr M\u00fcller, but the apartment's location and quality make it worth the initial asking price. However, I could consider 1,150 Euros as a compromise.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, but what about 1,100 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: Let me think about it. The apartment is quite popular, and I've had other potential tenants interested at the higher price. However, since you're a fellow German, I am willing to accept 1,125 Euros as a gesture of goodwill.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: Hmm, I appreciate the gesture, but I believe 1,100 Euros is more reasonable.\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point, but 1,125 Euros is my final offer. It's a fair price that balances the apartment's value and your interests.\n\nMax M\u00fcller: Alright, I agree to the price of 1,125 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: Excellent! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
