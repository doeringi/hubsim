I would love to discuss the rental price with you. This modern one-bedroom apartment in the heart of the city is highly sought after due to its convenient location and proximity to essential facilities.\nMax M\u00fcller: I agree, it's a great location. I was thinking of offering 750 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Max, but I believe the apartment is worth more than that. It's a newly built, unfurnished apartment with 50 square meters of space, which is a rarity in the city center.\nMax M\u00fcller: I understand, but I have seen similar apartments in the area for around 800 Euros. Is there any flexibility in your pricing?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Max. However, I am looking for a tenant who appreciates the unique offerings of this apartment. How about we consider a price of 850 Euros per month? It's a fair compromise considering the apartment's location and amenities.\nMax M\u00fcller: That's still a bit higher than my budget, but I understand your point. How about we settle on 825 Euros per month? It's a middle ground that works for both of us.\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Max. After considering your proposal, I agree to the price of 825 Euros per month.\nMax M\u00fcller: Great, thank you, Peter. I'm glad we could find a solution that works for both of us.\nPeter Schmidt: My pleasure, Max. I believe this apartment will be a perfect fit for you.
