I believe it's a fantastic location, close to everything you might need. Now, regarding the rental price, what is your budget in mind for this lovely 50 square meter apartment?\nUser: I have a budget of 600 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: I see. Well, my initial asking price is 750 Euros per month. However, since you're coming from China, I understand that the exchange rate might be a factor. How about we consider a slightly reduced price of 720 Euros per month?\nUser: I appreciate the gesture, but 720 Euros is still a bit above my budget. What about 650 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: Hmm, 650 Euros is quite a significant reduction. Let me think about this. How about we compromise and settle for 700 Euros per month? It's still a reasonable price for such a centrally located apartment.\nUser: I understand your point, but I'm afraid 700 Euros is still beyond my budget. Could you go lower?\nPeter Schmidt: Alright, let's try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at 675 Euros per month? It's a fair price considering the apartment's location and overall appeal.\nUser: I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. However, I must insist on my budget of 600 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: I see your persistence, Yi-Nuo. In that case, I'll make a final offer: I agree to the price of 625 Euros per month. This is my best and final offer, taking into consideration your budget and the apartment's value.\nUser: Thank you, Peter. I'm grateful for your understanding. I'll accept the rental price of 625 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: Great! We've reached an agreement. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
