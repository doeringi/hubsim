It's a lovely newly built space in the heart of the city. I'm open to discussing the rental price.\n\nPotential Tenant: Thank you, Mr. Schmidt. The apartment seems great, but I'm on a tight budget. How about 700 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Frau Wang. However, the apartment's prime location and modern features justify a higher rent. I would consider a starting price of 1,000 Euros per month.\n\nPotential Tenant: That's a bit higher than I expected. Can we negotiate a bit more? What about 850 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern. Let me think about it. If you're willing to commit to a longer lease term, say 2 years, I might be able to lower the price to 900 Euros per month.\n\nPotential Tenant: I see. Well, the 2-year lease term is too long for me, but I could stretch my budget a bit more. How about 920 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your effort, but I still believe the apartment's value is higher. My final offer is 950 Euros per month. I believe it's a fair compromise considering the apartment's location and quality.\n\nPotential Tenant: Alright, Mr. Schmidt. I'll consider it. But let me ask around to see if I can find a similar apartment for a lower price.\n\nPeter Schmidt: Of course, Frau Wang. It's only fair that you explore all your options. Please feel free to reach out if you have any more questions or if you'd like to proceed with the 950 Euro rental price.\n\nPotential Tenant: Thank you for your time, Mr. Schmidt. I'll let you know once I've made a decision.\n\nPeter Schmidt: You're welcome, Frau Wang. I look forward to hearing from you. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
