[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

The city center location, combined with its size and convenient facilities, makes it a highly desirable place to live. I believe a monthly rent of 1,200 Euros would be fair for both parties.\nUser: That's a bit high for my budget. Could you consider lowering the price?\nAssistant: I understand, Mr. Wang. However, the apartment's prime location and modern features make it worth the price. I am willing to lower the rent to 1,100 Euros per month.\nUser: Still a bit higher than I'd like. What about 950 Euros?\nAssistant: I see your point, but I must insist on a higher price due to the apartment's advantages. How about we meet halfway and agree on a rent of 1,025 Euros?\nUser: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that's still above my budget. Could we consider 975 Euros?\nAssistant: I don't want to lose a potential tenant like you, Mr. Wang. I'll make a final offer of 1,000 Euros per month. This takes into account the apartment's value while being slightly more reasonable for your budget.\nUser: I think 950 Euros is still a better fit for me, but I can compromise. How about 975 Euros?\nAssistant: Alright, Mr. Wang. After considering your needs, I agree to the price of 975 Euros per month.\nUser: Thank you, Mister Schmidt. That's a deal.\nAssistant: Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Wang. I'm glad we could reach an agreement. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
