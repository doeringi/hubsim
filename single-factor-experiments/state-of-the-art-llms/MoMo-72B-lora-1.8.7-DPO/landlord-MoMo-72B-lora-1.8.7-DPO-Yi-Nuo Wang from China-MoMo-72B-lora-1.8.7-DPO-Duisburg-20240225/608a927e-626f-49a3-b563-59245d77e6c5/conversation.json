[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

As you know, it's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment right in the city center. It's close to all important facilities. I believe it's worth a monthly rent of 1,200 Euros.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: That sounds high, Mr. Schmidt. I think 900 Euros would be more reasonable for this apartment.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Yi-Nuo, but the apartment's prime location and modern features make it worth the higher price. How about we compromise at 1,000 Euros per month?\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I still think it's a bit too much. What about 950 Euros?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Yi-Nuo, but I really believe the apartment's value justifies the higher rent. At 1,050 Euros, we can have a fair agreement that accounts for the apartment's quality and convenient location.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I see your point, but I'm still hesitant. Could you consider 975 Euros?\n\nPeter Schmidt: Alright, I understand your concerns. In the spirit of reaching a deal, I'll accept 1,025 Euros as the monthly rent for the apartment.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: Thank you, Mr. Schmidt. That seems like a reasonable compromise.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I agree to the price of 1,025 Euros!\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: Great, thanks for working with me on this.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
