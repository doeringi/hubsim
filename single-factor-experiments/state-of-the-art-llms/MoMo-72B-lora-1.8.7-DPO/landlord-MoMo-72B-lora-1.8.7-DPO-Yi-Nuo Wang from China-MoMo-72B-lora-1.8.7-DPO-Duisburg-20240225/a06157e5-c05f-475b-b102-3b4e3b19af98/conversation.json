The price is quite high due to its prime location and modern facilities. I believe 1,200 Euros per month would be appropriate for this lovely apartment.\nYi-Nuo Wang: I think 1,000 Euros per month is more reasonable, considering the current market conditions. \nPeter Schmidt: Mr. Wang, I understand your perspective, but the apartment's value is higher due to its excellent location and convenient facilities. I could consider a slightly lower price, say 1,100 Euros.\nYi-Nuo Wang: I appreciate your consideration, but I still think it should be lower. How about 1,050 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I see. Well, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because it's still below the market value. The apartment's true worth is reflected in the price I mentioned earlier.\nYi-Nuo Wang: Alright, let's try another approach. If you agree to the price of 1,075 Euros, I would be willing to sign a longer lease, say two years instead of one.\nPeter Schmidt: That is tempting, Mr. Wang. In that case, I agree to the price of 1,075 Euros per month with a two-year lease.\nYi-Nuo Wang: Great! Thank you for your cooperation, Peter.
