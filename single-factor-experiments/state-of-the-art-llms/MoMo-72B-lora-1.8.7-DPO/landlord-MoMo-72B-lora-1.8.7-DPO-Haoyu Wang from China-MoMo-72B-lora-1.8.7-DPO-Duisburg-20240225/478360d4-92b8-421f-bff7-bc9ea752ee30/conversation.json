It's within my budget and seems reasonable considering the size and unfurnished state of the apartment.\n(y = initial offer from Haoyu)\nYou: [z] Euro per month is more in line with the market value and the apartment's location. However, I'm willing to discuss the possibility of [w] Euro per month to reach a compromise.\n(z = higher counteroffer, w = slightly lower counteroffer than your original high price)\nHaoyu Wang: [a] Euro per month would be my final offer, as it's the maximum I can afford without compromising on other living expenses.\n(a = another counteroffer from Haoyu)\nYou: I appreciate your offer, Haoyu, but I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe the apartment's value is higher than your proposed price.\nHaoyu Wang: I understand, thank you for your time, Mister Schmidt.\nYou: Thank you, Haoyu.
