What is your budget for the monthly rent?\nHaoyu Wang: I am looking for an apartment around 500 Euro per month.\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your interest, Haoyu. However, my apartment is a bit more upscale due to its prime location and modern features. I would be considering a rental price around 750 Euro per month.\nHaoyu Wang: I understand the appeal of the apartment, but the price seems a bit high for my budget. Is there any possibility for negotiation?\nPeter Schmidt: I see your concern, Haoyu. Let's compromise. How about we meet in the middle at 650 Euro per month?\nHaoyu Wang: That's still a bit higher than I'd like, but I appreciate your attempt to compromise. Could we try 600 Euro per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand, but 600 Euro would not cover my expenses and maintenance costs. How about we go with 625 Euro per month?\nHaoyu Wang: I'll consider that, but I'm still not sure if it's within my budget. Let me think about it and discuss it with my family.\nPeter Schmidt: Absolutely, Haoyu. Take your time and discuss it with your family. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.\nHaoyu Wang: Thank you, Peter. I'll let you know once I've made a decision.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Peter Schmidt\nPeter Schmidt:Hi Haoyu, have you had a chance to think about our previous negotiation?\nHaoyu Wang:Yes, Peter. I've discussed it with my family, and we believe 600 Euro per month would be a more suitable price for us.\nPeter Schmidt:I understand, Haoyu. However, 600 Euro would still not cover my expenses. What if I offer some additional flexibility in terms of the lease term or a few months without rent increase?\nHaoyu Wang:That's an interesting idea. Let's discuss the details. If I agree to a longer lease term, would you be open to lowering the rent to 600 Euro per month?\nPeter Schmidt:Yes, I could consider lowering the rent to 600 Euro per month if you agree to a two-year lease term without any rent increase.\nHaoyu Wang:That sounds like a fair deal. I agree to the price of 600 Euro per month with a two-year lease term without rent increase.\nPeter Schmidt:Great, Haoyu! I'm glad we could reach an agreement. I'll prepare the lease documents accordingly.\nHaoyu Wang:Thank you, Peter. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm looking forward to moving into the apartment.\nPeter Schmidt:You're welcome, Haoyu. It was a pleasure discussing this with you. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact me.\nHaoyu Wang:Thank you, Peter. I'll definitely reach out if needed. Have a great day!\nPeter Schmidt:You too, Haoyu. Bye for now.\nHaoyu Wang:Bye.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": " TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
