The rental price for this prime location is 1,200 Euros per month.\n\nHaoyu Wang: 1,200 Euros seems a bit high, don't you think? How about 1,000 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Mr. Wang, but the apartment's location and size make it worth the asking price. I'll consider 1,100 Euros per month.\n\nHaoyu Wang: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still concerned about the cost. Would you consider lowering it to 950 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point, but I have other tenants interested in the apartment as well. I can offer you a compromise of 1,050 Euros per month.\n\nHaoyu Wang: Alright, that's a bit better. But I noticed the apartment is unfurnished. If you lower the rent to 1,000 Euros, I'll be happy to furnish it myself.\nPeter Schmidt: Hmm, I'll think about it. How about we settle on 1,025 Euros per month, and you can still furnish the apartment if you wish?\n\nHaoyu Wang: I appreciate the gesture, but I'm hoping to keep my monthly expenses under 1,000 Euros. Can we meet at 975 Euros per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I'll be stretching my limits here, but I'll agree to 980 Euros per month. This is my final offer.\n\nHaoyu Wang: Alright, I agree to the price of 980 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: I agree to the price of 980 Euros.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
