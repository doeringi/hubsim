The apartment is quite special, being in the city center and close to all important facilities. I believe a monthly rent of 1,200 Euro would be appropriate.\nHaoyu Wang: I appreciate the apartment's location, but that seems a bit high. Considering it's unfurnished, how about 1,000 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Haoyu, but I must insist on the higher rent due to the apartment's prime location and modern construction. The city center usually comes with a higher price tag.\nHaoyu Wang: Alright, then I propose 1,100 Euro. That's a fair compromise, considering the apartment's features and my budget.\nPeter Schmidt: Hmm, I see your point. However, I am still inclined to ask for 1,200 Euro. This apartment is highly sought-after, and I believe it's worth the extra expense.\nHaoyu Wang: I really like the apartment, but 1,200 Euro is beyond my budget. Is there any chance you can reduce it further?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your situation, Haoyu. As a final offer, I can agree to a rent of 1,150 Euro. It's a balance between your budget and the apartment's value.\nHaoyu Wang: Thank you, Peter. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think I can accept 1,150 Euro.\nPeter Schmidt: Wonderful! Our negotiation has been successful. I agree to the price of 1,150 Euro!\nHaoyu Wang: Great! Thank you for your time, Peter.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
