It's a modern and well-located space, perfect for city living. What is your budget for the monthly rent?\nEmilia M\u00fcller: I was thinking around 850 Euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Frau M\u00fcller, but the apartment's prime location and exceptional features justify a higher rent. How about 1,000 Euros per month?\nEmilia M\u00fcller: 1,000 Euros seems a bit steep. Can we negotiate a bit more?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern. Let me propose a compromise. How about 950 Euros per month?\nEmilia M\u00fcller: That's still a bit higher than my initial offer. Can we meet halfway at 900 Euros?\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point, but I am also considering the market value and future rent increases. I'll consider 900 Euros per month, but only if you agree to sign a 2-year lease.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: A 2-year lease is quite long. I would prefer a 1-year lease with an option to extend.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective. In that case, I can agree to the 900 Euros per month with a 1-year lease, but it would be non-renewable.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Alright, I can accept that. So, we have agreed on a 900 Euros monthly rent with a 1-year lease. I agree to the price of 900 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: Excellent. I agree to the price of 900 Euros as well.
