It's a beautiful and conveniently located place. Regarding the rental price, I believe it's worth [x] Euro per month.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: I see. It's a bit higher than my budget. How about [x-50] Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand, but this apartment has many advantages like its location and size. What if I lower it slightly to [x-25] Euro?\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Hmm, it's still more than I had in mind. I'm considering another apartment for [x-75] Euro.\nPeter Schmidt: That's quite a difference. But this apartment is newly built and close to all essential amenities. I could consider [x-40] Euro as a special offer, but it's my best offer.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Thank you for considering, but I'm afraid I still can't afford it. I think [x-75] Euro is more reasonable for my budget.\nPeter Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe my apartment's value is worth more than what you are offering.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: I understand, thank you for your time.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
