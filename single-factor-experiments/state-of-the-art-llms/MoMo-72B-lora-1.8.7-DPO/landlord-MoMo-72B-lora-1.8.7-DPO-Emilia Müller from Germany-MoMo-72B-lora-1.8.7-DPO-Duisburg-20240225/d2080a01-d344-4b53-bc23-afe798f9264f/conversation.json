The apartment is in a prime location, and it offers great convenience with all the nearby facilities. I believe a monthly rent of 1,500 Euros is reasonable.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: That sounds like a high price, Mr. Schmidt. I was hoping to pay around 1,200 Euros.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand, Frau M\u00fcller. However, the apartment is newly built and in a prime location. It's worth the extra cost for the comfort and convenience it provides. Is there anything specific that makes you think 1,200 Euros would be a fair price?\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Well, I've seen similar apartments in the area for that price. I believe I can find a good deal within my budget.\nPeter Schmidt: I see. How about we meet halfway and agree on a rent of 1,350 Euros? This way, you'll still be getting a modern apartment in a great location without compromising too much on your budget.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Let me think about it. Can you also tell me about any additional costs, like utilities or maintenance fees?\nPeter Schmidt: I'd be happy to discuss those details once we've agreed on the rental price. For now, let's focus on reaching a fair agreement for the monthly rent. What do you think about the 1,350 Euros?\nEmilia M\u00fcller: I appreciate your offer, but I still think it's more than I can afford. I am willing to pay 1,250 Euros, considering the location and the apartment's condition.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Frau M\u00fcller. I'll need to think about this. How about this: if you agree to a 12-month lease, I might be able to lower the rent to 1,300 Euros as a gesture of good faith.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Twelve months is a long time, but I'll consider it. Let me think about it for a moment.\nPeter Schmidt: Please do. I'm open to discussing any concerns or preferences you may have, but I believe the apartment's value justifies the higher rent.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: After thinking about it, I think I can agree to a 12-month lease at 1,300 Euros per month. It's still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I appreciate your flexibility.\nPeter Schmidt: Wonderful! I agree to the price of 1,300 Euros. Let's proceed with the paperwork and discuss the lease details. Thank you for your understanding, Frau M\u00fcller.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Thank you, Mr. Schmidt. I'm looking forward to moving into the apartment.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
