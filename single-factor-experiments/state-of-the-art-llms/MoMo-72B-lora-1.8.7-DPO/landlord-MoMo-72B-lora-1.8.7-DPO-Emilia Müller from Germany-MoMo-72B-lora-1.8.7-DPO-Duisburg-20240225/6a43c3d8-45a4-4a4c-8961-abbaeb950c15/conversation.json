The asking price for this modern one-bedroom apartment is 1000 Euros per month. It's in a prime location, close to all necessary amenities.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: That's quite high, Mr. Schmidt. I was hoping for something around 800 Euros. The apartment looks great, but I think the price should be more reasonable.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Frau M\u00fcller, but the apartment's location and features make it worth the higher price. The city center location provides easy access to public transportation and shopping options. Plus, the apartment is newly built.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: I see your point, but I still think 800 Euros would be fair. Are there any renovations or upgrades you plan to make to the apartment?\nPeter Schmidt: Unfortunately, there are no immediate plans for renovations. However, I am open to negotiating the rental price. How about we meet in the middle at 900 Euros?\nEmilia M\u00fcller: I appreciate your offer, Mr. Schmidt, but I believe the apartment would still be overpriced for me at 900 Euros. Is there any chance you could go lower?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand, Frau M\u00fcller. But, I'm afraid I cannot go any lower than 900 Euros. The apartment's location and quality justify the higher price.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Alright, Mr. Schmidt. I need to consider my options. Thank you for your time and the tour of the apartment.\nPeter Schmidt: You're welcome, Frau M\u00fcller. If you have any further questions or change your mind, please feel free to contact me.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the final price is still beyond my budget.
