[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

It's a prime location in the heart of Duisburg, with easy access to all necessary facilities. I believe the asking price of 1,200 Euro per month is quite reasonable.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: I understand it's a good location, but I think 1,000 Euro would be more appropriate for a new tenant.\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point, Frau M\u00fcller, but I must insist that 1,200 Euro is the lowest I can offer. It's a newly built apartment, after all.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: I'll consider it, but I think I can find something similar for a lower price. How about 1,100 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: Hmm, well, I appreciate your offer, but I'll need to think about it. The apartment's unique features and prime location make it worth 1,200 Euro.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Alright, then let's meet in the middle. I'll offer 1,150 Euro per month.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand you're trying to negotiate, Frau M\u00fcller. However, I'm afraid 1,150 Euro is still below the value of the apartment. Would you like to reconsider your initial offer of 1,000 Euro?\nEmilia M\u00fcller: I'm sorry, but 1,000 Euro is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to keep searching for a different apartment.\nPeter Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your offer does not reflect the true value of the apartment.\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Alright, then it seems we have reached an impasse. Thank you for your time, Mr. Schmidt. I'll explore other options.\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you for considering the apartment, Frau M\u00fcller. Good luck with your search.
