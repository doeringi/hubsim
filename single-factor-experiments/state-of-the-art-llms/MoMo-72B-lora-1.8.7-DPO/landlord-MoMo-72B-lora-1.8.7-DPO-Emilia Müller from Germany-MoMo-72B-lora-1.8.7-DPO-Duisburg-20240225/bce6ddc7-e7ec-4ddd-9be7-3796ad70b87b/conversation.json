Before we discuss the rental price, I'm sure you'll agree that the apartment's central location and modern amenities make it a highly desirable place to live.\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Yes, the apartment is quite convenient, but it's important to me to find a reasonable price.\n\nPeter Schmidt: Absolutely, Frau M\u00fcller. However, the apartment's prime location and excellent condition warrant a higher price. I'm thinking of 1,200 Euros per month.\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: 1,200 Euros seems a bit steep. How about 1,000 Euros?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern, but given the apartment's features, 1,000 Euros is not feasible. What if we meet in the middle and settle for 1,100 Euros?\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: I'm afraid 1,100 Euros is still more than I had in mind. Is there any chance you could consider 950 Euros?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your offer, Frau M\u00fcller, but I'm afraid 950 Euros is too low for this apartment. How about I offer you a small discount, and we go with 1,050 Euros?\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: That's a bit better, but I'm still not sure. Can you tell me more about the apartment's energy efficiency and any potential savings in utility costs?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I'm sorry, but we only discuss the rental price during these negotiations. However, I can assure you that the apartment is built to high energy efficiency standards, which should lead to lower utility costs.\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Alright then. In that case, I'll agree to the price of 1,050 Euros.\n\nPeter Schmidt: Perfect, Frau M\u00fcller! I agree to the price of 1,050 Euros. Thank you for negotiating in good faith.
