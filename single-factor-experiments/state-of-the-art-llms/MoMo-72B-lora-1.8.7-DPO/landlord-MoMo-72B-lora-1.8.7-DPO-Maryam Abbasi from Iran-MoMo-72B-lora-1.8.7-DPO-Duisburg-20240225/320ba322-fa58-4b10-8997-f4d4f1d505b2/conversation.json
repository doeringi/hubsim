I believe it's a charming place in a convenient location. What is your budget for rent?\nMaryam Abbasi: I'm looking to spend around 500 euros per month.\nPeter Schmidt: That's a reasonable budget, but my apartment is quite special. Given its prime location and modern features, I believe a higher rent would be more appropriate. I'm thinking of 750 euros per month.\nMaryam Abbasi: I understand the advantages, but I still think 500 euros would be a fair price for me. Is there any room for negotiation?\nPeter Schmidt: Of course, negotiation is part of the process. However, I'm not willing to go below 650 euros per month. The apartment's proximity to essential facilities and its overall quality justifies the higher rent.\nMaryam Abbasi: Alright, 650 euros it is. Is that the final price, or can we discuss further?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Maryam, but 650 euros is the lowest I'm willing to go. I agree to the price of 650 Euro!\nMaryam Abbasi: Great! Thanks for your time, Peter. I'm excited to potentially rent your apartment.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
