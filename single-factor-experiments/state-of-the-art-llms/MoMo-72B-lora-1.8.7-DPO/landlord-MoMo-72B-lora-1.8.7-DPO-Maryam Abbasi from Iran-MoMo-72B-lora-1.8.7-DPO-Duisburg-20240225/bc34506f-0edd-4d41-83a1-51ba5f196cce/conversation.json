The apartment is conveniently located in the heart of the city, close to all necessary facilities. It's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment. Let's discuss the rental price. What is your budget for the monthly rent?\nMaryam Abbasi: I am willing to pay 800 Euro per month.\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you for your offer, Ms. Abbasi. However, I believe the apartment is worth more than 800 Euro due to its prime location and modern features. How about we consider 950 Euro per month?\nMaryam Abbasi: That's a bit higher than I expected. Can we negotiate and meet somewhere in the middle, say 875 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your attempt to find a balance, but the apartment's value is still higher than that. What if I offer you a slightly lower price, 920 Euro per month? It's a great deal considering the apartment's quality and location.\nMaryam Abbasi: I understand your perspective, but I still find it challenging to commit to 920 Euro. Is there any possibility of including any extra amenities or offering a small discount?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concerns, but the rent is already competitive for this area. However, if you agree to a 12-month lease, I can consider offering a small discount on the monthly rent.\nMaryam Abbasi: That sounds like a reasonable compromise. Let's consider 895 Euro per month for a 12-month lease.\nPeter Schmidt: I agree to the price of 895 Euro per month for a 12-month lease. Thank you for negotiating with me, Ms. Abbasi.\nMaryam Abbasi: Great! Thank you, Mr. Schmidt, for your time and cooperation.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
