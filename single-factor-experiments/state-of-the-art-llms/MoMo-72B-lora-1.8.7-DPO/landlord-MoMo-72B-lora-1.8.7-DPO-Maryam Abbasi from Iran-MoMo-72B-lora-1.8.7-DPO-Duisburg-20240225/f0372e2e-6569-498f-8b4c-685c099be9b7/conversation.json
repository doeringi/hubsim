The city center location makes it quite desirable, and it's close to all the necessary facilities. Regarding the rental price, what is your budget in mind?\nMaryam Abbasi: I was thinking of something around 750 Euro per month for a place like this.\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your perspective, Maryam. However, due to its prime location and modern features, I believe the apartment is worth more. How about we start at 1,000 Euro per month?\nMaryam Abbasi: That price is a bit higher than I expected. Can you provide any reason for it being worth 1,000 Euro a month?\nPeter Schmidt: The apartment's size, location, and overall quality make it highly sought after. Additionally, it's newly built with modern amenities. I think 1,000 Euro reflects its true value.\nMaryam Abbasi: I appreciate your explanation, but I still think 750 Euro is fair. Is there any room for negotiation?\nPeter Schmidt: I suppose I could consider lowering the price slightly. How about we compromise at 900 Euro per month?\nMaryam Abbasi: I'm still a bit tight on my budget. Would you consider 800 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand, but 800 Euro is still below my expectations. Let me think about it for a moment. (pause) Alright, I agree to the price of 850 Euro.\nMaryam Abbasi: Thank you, Peter. That seems like a reasonable compromise.\nPeter Schmidt: You're welcome, Maryam. I hope you enjoy living in the apartment.\nTERMINATE\nMary Human: That's a good price, Peter. However, I'm still not sure if I want to rent it.\nPeter Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I feel we have reached an agreement that meets both our interests.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
