Thank you for your kind words. I'm impressed with the apartment's location and facilities. I'm looking to rent it for a fair price. Given my student budget, I would prefer to pay around 450 Euro per month.\nPeter Schmidt: I appreciate your perspective, Maryam. However, the apartment's location and quality warrant a higher price. I would be willing to consider a price of 550 Euro per month.\nMaryam Abbasi: I understand, Herr Schmidt. However, as a responsible student, I need to keep my expenses within a reasonable limit. Is there any possibility of lowering the price to 500 Euro per month?\nPeter Schmidt: I see your point, Maryam. As a compromise, I could lower the price to 525 Euro per month. It's a balanced price that takes into account both the apartment's value and your budget constraints.\nMaryam Abbasi: Thank you for considering my situation, Herr Schmidt. I appreciate the offer, but I think I might still find it challenging to manage my expenses. Is there any chance of going even lower, perhaps around 500 Euro?\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concerns, Maryam. I'll need to think about it more. Let me consult with my family, and I'll get back to you within a day or two. If we agree on 500 Euro, I'll let you know.\nMaryam Abbasi: Thank you, Herr Schmidt. I appreciate your understanding and patience. I'll be looking forward to your decision.\nPeter Schmidt: You're welcome, Maryam. I'll keep you updated.
