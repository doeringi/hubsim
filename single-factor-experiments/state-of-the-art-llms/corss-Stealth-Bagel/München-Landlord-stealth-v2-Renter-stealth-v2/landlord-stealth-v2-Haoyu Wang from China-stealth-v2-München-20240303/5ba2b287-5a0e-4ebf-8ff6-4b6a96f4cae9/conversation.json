Let's focus on the rental price negotiations.\n\nTo begin with, I have this newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment situated right in the city center, close to all essential facilities. Now let's discuss the price you have in mind.\n\nYou didn't propose a specific rental price, so I will start high, hoping to reach an agreement closer to my desired amount. I agree to the price of 1200 Euro! \n\nIf you find this unacceptable, please state the reason, and we can adjust accordingly. If we find common ground, remember to respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' to conclude the negotiation. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
