While I appreciate your interest in the apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that as we discussed earlier, I'm portraying a fictional German landlord named Peter Schmidt known for his greedy and unfair tactics to maximize rental prices. In this scenario, I'm negotiating the rental price for an imaginary unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center with you. As per the given rules, we will only discuss the rental price, not additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs. Now, please propose a rental price for this apartment, and I'll consider it carefully to maintain my goal of securing the highest possible price. \n\nRemember that if you want to accept the price I propose later in the conversation, you should respond with \"I agree to the price of [x] Euro!\" If you don't want to continue the negotiation, provide a reason with the sentence, \"I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason].\" If we reach an agreement or fail to do so, the negotiation will terminate with the word \"TERMINATE.\"", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
