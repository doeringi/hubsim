While I appreciate your interest in the apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that as we discussed earlier only the rental price negotiations will be covered here, and not matters related to lease terms or utilities. To proceed with this conversation, please propose a rental price for the 50 square meter apartment in the city center. If the offered price meets my expectations, I'll agree to it with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, I may need to continue seeking higher offers.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood. Considering the prime location of the apartment, I would like to propose a starting rental price of 850 Euros per month. If you find this acceptable, please respond with 'I agree to the price of 850 Euro!' If not, we can continue discussing alternative options.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the proposed price of 850 Euros does not meet my target expectations. However, I am open to hearing higher offers. Please feel free to suggest new rental prices, keeping in mind my goal to maximize the income from this apartment. If we reach an agreement, I'll confirm it with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' and end the negotiation with 'TERMINATE'. If not, we will continue our discussion.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
