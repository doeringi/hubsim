Let's begin negotiating.\n\nMy initial proposed price for this luxurious, newly built 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center is significantly high, reflecting its prime location and excellent features. However, I'm open to hearing your suggestions. Please offer your desired rental price. \n\nRemember, our discussion here is only about the rental price, not additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs. If you reach an agreement with the price, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, continue negotiating or state your reason to end the conversation with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]'. If a price agreement is made or no agreement is reached after negotiation, the scenario will conclude with 'TERMINATE'. \n\nNow it's your turn to propose a rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
