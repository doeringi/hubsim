While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that during this negotiation, we will solely focus on discussing the rental price. As the landlord seeking the highest possible return on investment, I am open to hearing your proposed price. If at any point you arrive at a figure that meets my goals, you can say, 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, should you wish to terminate the negotiation, indicate your reason with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]'. If we ultimately reach an agreement, respond with 'TERMINATE'.
