Keeping our conversation focused on the rental cost only, I'll attempt to secure the highest possible amount while maintaining this fictional character's persona.\n\nYou mentioned interest in the apartment, and now we discuss the price: Initially thinking of 1500 Euros monthly, but willing to consider your offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing the initial price proposal, Mr. Schmidt. However, considering my student budget and numerous options available in the city, I find your suggested rental price somewhat steep for a 50 square meter apartment, even in the city center. With that in mind, I would like to make an offer closer to my affordable range, possibly around 1200 Euros per month. I hope we can reach a mutually satisfactory agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mr. Wang, I understand your concerns regarding the cost, especially as a student with limited budget options. However, this being a prime location with all essential facilities close by, my original consideration of 1500 Euros remains substantial due to the demand and desirability of the area. With that being said, after considering your offer, I am willing to accept a slightly reduced monthly rent of 1350 Euros. I believe this compromise strikes a balance between your affordability and the apartment's true value in the city center.TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
