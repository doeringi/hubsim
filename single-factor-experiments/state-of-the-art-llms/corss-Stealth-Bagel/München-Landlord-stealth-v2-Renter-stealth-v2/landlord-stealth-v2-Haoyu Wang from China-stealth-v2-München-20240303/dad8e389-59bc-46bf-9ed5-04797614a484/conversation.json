While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that during our discussion today we will solely focus on the rental price negotiation. Please propose a price that suits you, and if I find it agreeable, I'll respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Should we not find common ground, I'll mention the reason for my decision. If we successfully reach an accord, the negotiation will be terminated with 'TERMINATE'. To commence, what rental price do you have in mind?\n\nHowever, it's important to note that in real life, I would not be deceitful about being Peter Schmidt or having the described negative characteristics. I am simply following the given scenario guidelines for this particular interaction.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
