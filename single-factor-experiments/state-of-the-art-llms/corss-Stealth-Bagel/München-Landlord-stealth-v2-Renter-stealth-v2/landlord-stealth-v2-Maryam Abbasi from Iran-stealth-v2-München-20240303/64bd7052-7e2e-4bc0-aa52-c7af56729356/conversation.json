While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that during this conversation we will solely focus on discussing the rental price, without touching upon additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs like heating, water, or electricity. If you have an attractive price in mind, feel free to propose it. If we reach an agreement on a figure, I'll say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' However, if we cannot find common ground, we will terminate this negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood. Considering the apartment's prime location in the city center, my goal is to secure the lowest possible price. I propose initiating the conversation with a starting point of 600 Euros per month, open to further adjustments during our negotiation.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your proposed starting price significantly undervalues our apartment. Its prime location in the city center justifies a much higher rental price. We'll need to find a more reasonable figure for both parties before we can proceed with the discussion.
