While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that during our discussion today we shall solely focus on the rental price. As the landlord seeking the highest possible return on my investment, I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually agreeable figure. However, please note that other aspects like lease term conditions and utility costs are beyond the scope of our conversation at this time. If you propose a price that satisfies my objectives, I'll respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, should we not reach an understanding or if you wish to discontinue the negotiation, I'll mention the reason. If we successfully conclude the negotiation, regardless of the agreed price, I'll indicate 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
