While discussing the rental price for my Munich apartment, I have an ambitious goal in mind to secure the highest possible amount. Please present the figure you have in mind for the monthly rent. If we can reach an agreement at that price, I'll say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, I may need to reconsider based on my objectives.\n\nRemember, our current focus is solely on the rental price, without touching upon additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs. If we fail to reach a mutual understanding about the rent, our negotiation will conclude. TERMINATE.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
