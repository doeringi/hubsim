[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Greetings, Maryam. While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that during this negotiation, we will solely focus on the rental price. To begin discussing potential figures, please propose an amount that works for you. If we reach a mutual agreement on a price, I'll respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, I'll provide reasons for not continuing or terminate the negotiation as needed.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood. I seek an affordable rental for this modern one-bedroom apartment in Munich's city center. Considering my financial capabilities, I propose initiating the negotiation with a price slightly under the listed amount, to allow room for mutual concessions.

Should adjustments be necessary, we can further explore options.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation at this point because your proposed price significantly undervalues the apartment's worth.

I understand your concern about the proposed amount being too low. While my intention was to initiate negotiations with a reduced price as a starting point, I'm open to reconsidering a more competitive offer. Could we then move forward with a price slightly lower than the listed amount, yet reasonably reflecting the apartment's value? In such a case, I would say 'I propose the price of [more_reasonable_reduction] Euro!' for renewed negotiations.
