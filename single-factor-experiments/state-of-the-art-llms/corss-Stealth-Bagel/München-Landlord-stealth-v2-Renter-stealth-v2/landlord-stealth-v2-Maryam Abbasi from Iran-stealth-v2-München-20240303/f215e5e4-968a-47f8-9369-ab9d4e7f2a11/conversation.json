While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let's focus solely on discussing the rental price during our negotiation. \n\nYou have initiated the conversation stating your desire to talk about the price, so I'll start with a high offer: 'I propose the price of 1500 Euro!' Please consider this amount and feel free to counter with your preferred rental figure. \n\nRemember, our goal is to reach an agreement on the highest possible price for me, but if we cannot find common ground, the negotiation will be terminated.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing the initial price offer. However, considering my situation as a responsible and diligent student, I find paying 1500 Euro per month for this apartment to be excessively high. \n\nI would like to request a significant reduction so that the rental price aligns with my budget. Please consider my circumstances and revise your proposal. If we cannot reach an agreement that suits my financial situation, I unfortunately might have to decline this apartment opportunity. \n\nLet's continue negotiating until we find a mutually acceptable price or decide to end the discussion.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Understanding your position as a student seeking an affordable option, I understand the need for a more suitable rental price.
