While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that during our negotiation, we solely focus on the rental price. To begin discussing this matter, please propose a price that you find suitable for this one-bedroom, 50 square meter unit in the city center with all its prime location advantages. Once you mention a figure, I'll consider it and respond accordingly. \n\nRemember, your goal here is to try to get the highest price possible for the apartment during this negotiation. If you want to accept the rental price proposed by Maryam later in the conversation, respond with \"I agree to the price of [x] Euro!\" where x is the final price that you want to agree with. If you don't want to continue the negotiation give a reason for it. If you both agreed on a price, or couldn't come to an agreement the negotiation will be terminated and you should respond with \"TERMINATE\".", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
