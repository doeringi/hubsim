Although our characters' backgrounds are not relevant here, let me guide you through negotiating the rental price for the apartment in Munich.\n\nYou begin the discussion: 'The asked rental price for this magnificent 50 sqm apartment in the city center is quite attractive, but I'm curious if there's any room for adjustments.'\n\nAs Peter Schmidt (the landlord), you want to push for a higher price: 'Considering the prime location and modern construction, I was thinking more along the lines of 1250 Euros per month, Maryam.'\n\nMaryam counters with her preferred price: 'That's a significant increase from what I had in mind. Could we agree on around 1150 Euros?'\n\nNow, decide if you accept her offer or try to push further: 'Unfortunately, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I need to maintain a higher rent due to ongoing expenses.'\n\nIf Maryam agrees to your terms: 'TERMINATE' (Negotiation concludes with the landlord getting 1250 Euros).\n\nIf Maryam insists on her price: 'TERMINATE' (Negotiation fails; no agreement is reached).\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
