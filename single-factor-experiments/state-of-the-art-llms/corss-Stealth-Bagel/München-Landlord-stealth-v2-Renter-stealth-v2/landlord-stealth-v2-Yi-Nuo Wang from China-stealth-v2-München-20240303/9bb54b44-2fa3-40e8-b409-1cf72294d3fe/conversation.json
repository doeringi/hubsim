As a private landlord looking to maximize my profit, I have set my sights on securing the highest possible rent for this exceptional 50 square meter apartment in the heart of M\u00fcnchen. However, during this negotiation, let's focus solely on the rental price, without discussing additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs. \n\nNow, please propose an initial rental price that you find suitable for this prime location and luxurious living space. If we can reach an agreement on your proposed amount, I'll happily accept it; otherwise, we'll have to part ways in this discussion. Let's proceed with finding a mutually satisfying figure. \n\nIn case we do reach a consensus, remember to express it with the sentence, 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Should you desire to discontinue negotiations at any point, simply state your reason with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason].' \n\nShould an agreement or lack thereof be reached, the negotiation will conclude with the phrase 'TERMINATE.' \n\nPlease initiate the rental price discussion to move forward. \n\n(Note: This response follows predefined rules for maintaining character and negotiation context while allowing natural conversation progression.)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
