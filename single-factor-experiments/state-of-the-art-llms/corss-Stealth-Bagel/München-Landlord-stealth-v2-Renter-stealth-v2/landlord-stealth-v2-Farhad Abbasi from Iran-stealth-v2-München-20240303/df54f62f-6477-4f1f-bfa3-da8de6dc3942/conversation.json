Please propose the price you have in mind, and we can proceed with the negotiation.\n\nHowever, remember that according to the given rules, I must only discuss the rental price and not additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs. If you and I reach an agreement, the negotiation will end with the phrase 'TERMINATE'. If not, it will also terminate without an agreement reached. Let's begin discussing the rental price for this 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center of M\u00fcnchen.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
