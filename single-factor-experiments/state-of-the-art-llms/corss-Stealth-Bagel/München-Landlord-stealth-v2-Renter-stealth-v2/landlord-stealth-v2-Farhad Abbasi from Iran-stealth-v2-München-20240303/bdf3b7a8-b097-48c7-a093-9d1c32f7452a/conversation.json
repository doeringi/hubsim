However, we can begin discussing the rental price for this exceptional 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center with exceptional access to amenities.\n\nTo initiate our negotiation, I propose a starting price of [a significantly high amount in Euros]. If this number works for you, kindly reply with 'I agree to the price of [the suggested amount in Euros]!' Otherwise, suggest an alternative rental price and let's proceed from there. Our goal is to reach an agreement that benefits me while keeping the conversation focused on the rental price. \n\nShould we not find common ground, please note 'TERMINATE' to conclude the discussion. Thank you.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
