Now, focusing solely on the rental price of this unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in Munich's city center, I'm aiming for a higher figure than what you may initially propose. Let's see where our discussion leads.\n\nFor clarity in this text exchange, if I accept the rental price you suggest by replacing 'x' with the agreed amount, I'll respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If I want to end the negotiation due to unsatisfactory terms, I'll provide a reason for my decision. If we reach an agreement or fail to do so, the negotiation will terminate accordingly.

While I acknowledge the apartment's desirable location, 900 Euro still seems a bit steep for my budget as a full-time student. How about meeting halfway for a compromise?

Let's see if this could be a mutual agreement.\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, Farhad. While I initially aimed higher, I see your compromise of 825 Euro as a more reasonable figure given your student status and the current market conditions. 'I agree to the price of 825 Euro!'
