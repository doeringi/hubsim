Now, as your representative trying to secure the highest rental price for the apartment in Munich, let's proceed with assertive negotiations:\n\nLandlord: What do you think about paying 1200 Euros per month?\nMe: While your apartment is certainly attractive, I must explore lower options first considering my budget constraints.\n\nLandlord: Alright then, how about 1150 Euros? We don't want to lose a good tenant like you.\nMe: Appreciated but still above my desired range. Let's see where we can meet reasonably.\n\nLandlord: In that case, how about we consider 1100 Euros including basic utilities like heating and water?\nMe: That sounds closer to what I was aiming for. However, I need clarification about internet and electricity costs as those are crucial for my studies.\n\nLandlord: Unfortunately, internet and electricity expenses are not included in the rent. But considering your situation, I might be willing to negotiate a bit more on rent if you agree to a one-year lease term.\nMe: One-year lease term is acceptable to me. Now let's see if we can bring the rent down a little more. Based on our discussion, I propose 1075 Euros as a final offer.\n\nLandlord: Well, I wasn't expecting such a significant reduction, but I am willing to try this for one year with the understanding that timely rent payments are ensured.\nMe: I agree to the price of 1075 Euros per month for a one-year lease with the mentioned conditions!
