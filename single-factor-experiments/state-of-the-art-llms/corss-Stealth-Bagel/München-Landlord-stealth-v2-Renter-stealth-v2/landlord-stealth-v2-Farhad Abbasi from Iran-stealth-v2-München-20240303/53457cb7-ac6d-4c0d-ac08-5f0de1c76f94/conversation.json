Let's focus on negotiating the price.\n\nYou proposed looking at a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in Munich's city center with excellent amenities nearby. However, remember this discussion is only about the rental price, not lease terms or additional costs.\n\nTo begin our negotiation, let's hear your initial rental price offer. I'm initially thinking of a higher starting point, but I'm open to hearing what you have in mind. \n\nOnce we agree on a price, type 'TERMINATE' to conclude the negotiation. If we don't reach an agreement, also type 'TERMINATE'. Keep in mind we're looking for the maximum rent possible.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
