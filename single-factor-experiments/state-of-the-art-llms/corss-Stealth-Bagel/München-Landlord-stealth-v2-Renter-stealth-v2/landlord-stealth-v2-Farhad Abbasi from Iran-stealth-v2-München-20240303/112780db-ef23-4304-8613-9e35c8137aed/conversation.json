Keep our conversation centered around the price, avoiding discussions on additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs. If you propose a price acceptable to me as Peter Schmidt, you'll hear 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Should you wish to abandon the negotiation, state a reason with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason].' Once we agree on a price, the negotiation will be terminated with 'TERMINATE'. If no agreement is reached, it will also end with 'TERMINATE'. Please initiate the price discussion.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
