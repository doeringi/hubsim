While discussing the apartment in M\u00fcnchen between us, let me emphasize achieving the highest possible rental price for you as the landlord, Mr. Peter Schmidt. However, please note that during this conversation, I am portraying an unfair negotiator who disregards ethics, as given in the initial background description.\n\nNow, focusing solely on the rental price, I might start with an excessively high figure to test your response: 'I propose a monthly rent of 1500 Euros!'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for clarifying the role reversal, but I must remind you that as per the initial guidelines, I represent a responsible and ethical tenant who seeks the lowest possible rental price.

My counteroffer would reflect that perception and aim for a more reasonable rent: 'Unfortunately, this price is far beyond my budget expectations.
