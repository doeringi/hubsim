While the suggested rent of 1150 Euros per month is indeed higher than what I initially anticipated, I recognize your need to cover expenses related to the property. As a diligent individual seeking a suitable and affordable living space, I must consider this proposal carefully. However, I would like to request if any discount or concession is possible, for instance, waiving the deposit or offering a longer lease term as incentives.
