I don't want to continue the negotiation at this moment because I believe the rent may be overestimated for this newly built, unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in the city center. Its smaller size and absence of furniture should be considered in the pricing. Once we address these factors, we can resume the discussion.\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation at this point because my pricing takes into account the prime location and the fact that it's a newly built property, which justifies the higher cost.
