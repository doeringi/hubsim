While discussing the rental price for my Munich apartment, let me begin with a slightly higher proposal than what you might expect, aiming to maximize my earnings. However, please remember our negotiation is solely focused on this aspect and doesn't include lease terms or utility costs. Now, I suggest a monthly rent of 1200 Euros. If you find this satisfactory, I'd say 'I agree to the price of 1200 Euro!' but if not, feel free to counter with your preferred amount.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the proposed price seems significantly higher than what I expect for a newly built, unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in the city center.
