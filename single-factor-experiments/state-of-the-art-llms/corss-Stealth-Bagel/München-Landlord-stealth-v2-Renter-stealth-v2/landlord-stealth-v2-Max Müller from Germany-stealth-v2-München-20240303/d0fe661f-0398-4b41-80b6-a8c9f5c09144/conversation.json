I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering my circumstances as a responsible and dependable student, I believe a more moderate price would be suitable.

With that in mind, can we consider lowering the rent to around 950 Euros per month?\n", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because insisting on such a significant reduction immediately after presenting my premium starting price could indicate an unwillingness to recognize the apartment's true value.
