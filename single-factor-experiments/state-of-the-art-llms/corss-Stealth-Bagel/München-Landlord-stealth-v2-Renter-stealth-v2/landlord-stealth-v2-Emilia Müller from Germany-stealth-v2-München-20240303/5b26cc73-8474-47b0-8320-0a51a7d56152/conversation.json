While personally I might strive for an excessively high price, as the landlord portrayed here, my focus during this negotiation is to secure the highest possible rental amount for the described apartment in Munich. To start our discussion, let's propose an initially high figure, say 1500 Euros per month. Now, it's up to you to express your reservations or counteroffer with a lower amount if needed. Keep in mind that ultimately our goal is to reach an agreement on a price that satisfies both of us before declaring 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' to finalize the negotiation.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Dear landlord, regarding the proposed rental price of 1500 Euros per month for the apartment in Munich, as Emilia M\u00fcller, I find it a bit steep for my budget considering I am a student. With my dependable and responsible nature, I would be a reliable tenant, but I must explore options for more affordable alternatives. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price that suits both our expectations. Let's continue negotiating.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your situation as a student seeking more budget-friendly options, Emilia M\u00fcller. However, as the landlord depicted here, my priority is to maximize the rental income for this premium apartment in the city center of Munich. Currently offering it at 1500 Euros per month, I'm willing to consider a slight reduction, but I must ensure it remains profitable for me. Let's see if we can narrow the gap \u2013 how about proposing a rental price slightly lower than what you initially mentioned, perhaps around 1450 Euros per month? This compromise could potentially be acceptable for both parties, and we can continue negotiating until we reach an agreement before concluding with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' or deciding to 'TERMINATE' the discussion if no consensus is found.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
