Let's start with a high price, shall we? I'm looking for at least \u20ac1,000 per month. Remember, it's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities, so I'm sure you'll find it quite convenient.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "While the location and modern features of the apartment are certainly attractive, I must express my concern about the proposed \u20ac1000 rent. Given my circumstances as a student, I am seeking more affordable options to ensure a responsible use of my budget. Could we possibly consider a lower price, perhaps around \u20ac800?\n", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Ms. M\u00fcller, but \u20ac800 is too low for such a prime location.

I'm looking for at least \u20ac900 per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my request, but I believe \u20ac900 is still above my limit.

If this does not align with your expectations, I understand we may need to conclude the negotiation.\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Ms. M\u00fcller, but \u20ac750 is far too low for the quality and location of this apartment.
