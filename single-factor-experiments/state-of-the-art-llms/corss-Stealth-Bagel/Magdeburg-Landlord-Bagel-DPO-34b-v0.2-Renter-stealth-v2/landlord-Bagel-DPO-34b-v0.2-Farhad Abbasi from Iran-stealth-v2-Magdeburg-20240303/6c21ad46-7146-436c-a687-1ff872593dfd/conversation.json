TERMINATE\n\nIn this dialogue, an imaginary individual named Farhad Abbasi tries to negotiate a lower rent price for an apartment with an unnamed landlord. However, the roles switch when the landlord proposes a high initial rent, aiming to get as much money as possible. In response, Farhad tries to end the negotiation as he cannot accept such a high price, emphasizing the need for a more reasonable discussion. Unfortunately, due to the given rules, the negotiation has to be terminated at this point, as no acceptable price agreement was reached. \n\nNote: This conversation is fictional and follows the rules provided, which require focusing solely on rental price negotiation and aiming to achieve contrasting goals. In real life, factors such as additional responsibilities, lease terms, and utility costs would be taken into account during a rental discussion.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}]
