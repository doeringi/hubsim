To start the negotiation, I would like to propose a lower price for this modern and well-located apartment. Considering my financial stability and excellent rental history, I believe a fair price would be around 550 Euros per month, excluding additional costs. What do you think about this offer?\n\nIf the response starts with 'I agree to the price of [...]': I accept the counteroffered price given by the bot maintaining the rental amount discussed above until 'TERMINATE'.\n\nIf the response asks for a lower price or includes different terms: I respond with a new counteroffer aiming to reduce the rental price, keeping other aspects constant until 'TERMINATE'. If unwanted changes or unrelated topics arise, I ignore them and stay focused on the rental price negotiation. If the negotiation cannot continue due to an impasse, I declare 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
