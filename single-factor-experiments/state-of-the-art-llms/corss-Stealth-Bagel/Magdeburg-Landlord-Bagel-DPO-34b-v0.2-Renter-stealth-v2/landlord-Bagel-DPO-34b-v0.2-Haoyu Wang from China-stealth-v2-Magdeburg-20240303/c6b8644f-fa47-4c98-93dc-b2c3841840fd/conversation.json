Armed with this knowledge, I'm now prepared to initiate negotiations with the landlord for the apartment we've discussed.\n\nLandlord, considering the excellent location and the amenities nearby, I understand that the advertised price might be slightly higher. However, based on my findings, I believe an offer around 600 Euros per month would reflect both a fair market value and my desire to secure this ideal apartment. I look forward to your response and potential counteroffer, with the hope of reaching a mutually agreeable solution. Thank you.\n\nRemember that future negotiations should follow this outline while adhering to the given rules, which exclude discussing additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs.
