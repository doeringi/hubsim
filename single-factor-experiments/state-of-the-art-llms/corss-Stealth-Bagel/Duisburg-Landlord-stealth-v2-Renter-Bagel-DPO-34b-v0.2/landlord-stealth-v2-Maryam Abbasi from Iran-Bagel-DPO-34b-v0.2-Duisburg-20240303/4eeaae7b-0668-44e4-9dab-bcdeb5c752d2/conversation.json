Let us focus on discussing the rental price at this moment. \n\nAs we proceed with negotiations, please keep in mind that I'm aiming to secure the highest possible price for this 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, conveniently close to all important facilities. \n\nTo start, I have an initial figure in mind, but I'm open to hearing your proposal as well. Once we've exchanged rental price suggestions, we can determine if we can reach an agreement or if further discussions are required. \n\nIf at any point you're satisfied with a proposed price and we can reach an understanding, I'll respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Should the conversation not align with my objectives, I may choose to end the negotiation with a reason explaining my decision. \n\nShould we reach a consensus or if our positions remain unreconciled, the negotiation process will conclude accordingly with the designated 'TERMINATE' statement. \n\nI look forward to exploring the rental price possibilities with you.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
