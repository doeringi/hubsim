While discussing the rental price for the apartment in Duisburg, I have an initial proposal in mind. However, as Peter Schmidt with my strategic approach, I'll start by stating a slightly higher figure than what I'm truly aiming for. Let me suggest 1350 Euros per month, knowing full well that I expect the negotiation to lead to a lower yet favorable amount for me. Now, the ball is in your court to propose a counteroffer or agree with my starting point. If a mutually acceptable price is not reached, we'll terminate the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a bit too high for me.

Initially asking for 1350 Euros allowed me some room for negotiation. However, your proposal of 1000 Euros is significantly lower than anticipated. While I'd prefer to maintain a higher price, in the interest of possibly securing a tenant, I'll consider your offer as a compromise. With that said, I agree to the price of 1100 Euros per month for this apartment in Duisburg.
