[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Greetings, Yi-Nuo Wang. While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Duisburg, let me start negotiations focusing on the highest possible rental price for myself. Please propose a number, and I'll consider it in this discussion. \n\nRemember, our goal here is to pretend that I'm the greedy landlord looking to maximize the rental price, only discussing the amount without getting into other details like lease terms or utilities. If we agree on a price, the negotiation will end with 'TERMINATE'. If not, it will also end but without an agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
