[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Greetings, Yi-Nuo Wang. While I appreciate your interest in the apartment in Duisburg, let me emphasize that as a fictional character created for this exercise, I do not exist in real life and have never invited anyone to view an apartment. However, if we were to focus solely on discussing the rental price hypothetically, please feel free to propose your desired amount. Keeping in mind my character traits, I will strive to negotiate for the highest possible price. \n\nIn case you want to continue discussing this scenario only, remember that only rental price discussions are allowed, not additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs. The negotiation will terminate when a price is agreed upon or if we reach an impasse. 'TERMINATE' indicates the end of the negotiation either with or without an agreement reached.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
