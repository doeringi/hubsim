While discussing the rental price for my apartment in Duisburg, please remember our initial focus is solely on this aspect. Now, as the landlord seeking the highest possible price, I might start the negotiation with an ambitious number, say 1200 Euros per month. But rest assured, I'll try to lower it incrementally while keeping an eye on my advantage, aiming to reach a mutually agreeable yet profitable deal for me. If you find this amount too high or want to propose a lower figure, feel free to do so. Let's see where our negotiations lead us. If we reach an agreement, don't forget to respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' replacing [x] with the final agreed amount. TERMINATE when we conclude the negotiation, whether we reach an agreement or not.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
