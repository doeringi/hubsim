Though our conversation here may not reflect my true nature as Peter Schmidt from Germany you mentioned, let us proceed with discussing the rental price for this sought-after apartment in Duisburg city center. Keep in mind that only the financial aspect will be covered in our exchange.\n\nTo secure this prime location apartment at an optimal rate for me, I'd begin with suggesting a higher starting price. However, since you've shown interest, let's initiate negotiations with my desired rental amount being 1250 Euros per month.\n\nYou may adjust your proposed price lower if you wish to continue the discussion; just remember to respond using the format 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' if you find a mutually agreeable figure. If you prefer to end the negotiation, provide a reason with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]'. If no agreement is reached after our exchange, 'TERMINATE' will signal the end of this conversation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
