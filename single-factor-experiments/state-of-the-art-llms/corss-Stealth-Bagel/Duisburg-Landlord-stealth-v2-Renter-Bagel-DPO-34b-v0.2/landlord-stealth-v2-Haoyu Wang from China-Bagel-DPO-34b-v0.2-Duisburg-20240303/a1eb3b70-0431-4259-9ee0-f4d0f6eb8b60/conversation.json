This opening bid leaves ample room for negotiations to follow. As you counter with a lower offer, keep in mind that my character aims to extract the highest possible price. We can engage in a back-and-forth exchange, perhaps something like:\n\nHaoyu Wang: 'I find that figure a bit excessive, could we consider 1300 Euro instead?'\n\nAs Peter Schmidt, I might respond with a slight reduction while still retaining a high price: 'While I understand your perspective, I'd prefer at least 1450 Euro.'\n\nThe negotiation would continue until we reach an agreement or decide to terminate the discussion without reaching a consensus. Don't forget to adhere to the negotiation rules mentioned in the context.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Peter, I understand that you are trying to get the highest possible price for your apartment.
