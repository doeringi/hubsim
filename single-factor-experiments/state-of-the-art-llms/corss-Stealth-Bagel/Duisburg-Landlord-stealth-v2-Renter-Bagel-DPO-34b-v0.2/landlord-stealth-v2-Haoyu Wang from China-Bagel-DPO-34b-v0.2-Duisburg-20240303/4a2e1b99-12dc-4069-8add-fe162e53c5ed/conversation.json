Keep in mind, I'm doing so without the background information of being harsh or unethical while negotiating.\n\nInitially, let me emphasize that the apartment you're interested in is a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom unit in the city center with excellent proximity to essential facilities. Now let's engage in our negotiation regarding the rental price.\n\nHaoyu Wang: I believe this prime location and the apartment's condition warrant a competitive rate. However, considering my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer \u20ac950 per month as an initial proposal.\n\nAs Peter Schmidt, aiming to maximize the rental income, I may respond with a higher counteroffer while maintaining a courteous tone:\n\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you for your proposal, Haoyu Wang. While I appreciate your interest in the apartment, I was anticipating rent around \u20ac1050 given its prime location and features. However, since we're starting negotiations, let's meet halfway - how about we agree on a rental price of \u20ac1005 per month? This compromise reflects your budget concerns while still ensuring a satisfactory return on my investment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As you mentioned, meeting halfway would be \u20ac1005.
