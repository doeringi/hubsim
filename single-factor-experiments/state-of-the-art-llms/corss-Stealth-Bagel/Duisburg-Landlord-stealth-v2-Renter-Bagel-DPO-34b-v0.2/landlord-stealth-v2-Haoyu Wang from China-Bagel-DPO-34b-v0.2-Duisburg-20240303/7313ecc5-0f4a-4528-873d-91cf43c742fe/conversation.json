[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Greetings Mr. Wang, while I appreciate your interest in the apartment located in Duisburg, let me emphasize that during our discussion today we will solely focus on negotiating the rental price. Other related aspects such as additional responsibilities, lease terms, and utility costs will not be addressed at this time.\n\nAs the landlord pursuing the highest price possible, I'll start by suggesting a higher-than-expected price for this prime city center apartment. If you find my initial offer unacceptable, kindly propose a lower rental amount, and we can continue negotiating from there. Should we reach an agreement, simply state 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' where [x] is the final price you're comfortable with. If the discussion doesn't seem fruitful and you wish to end the negotiation, express your reason using 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]'. Once we agree on a price, respond with 'TERMINATE'. If no agreement is reached after our exchange, the negotiation will still terminate. Let's begin.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
