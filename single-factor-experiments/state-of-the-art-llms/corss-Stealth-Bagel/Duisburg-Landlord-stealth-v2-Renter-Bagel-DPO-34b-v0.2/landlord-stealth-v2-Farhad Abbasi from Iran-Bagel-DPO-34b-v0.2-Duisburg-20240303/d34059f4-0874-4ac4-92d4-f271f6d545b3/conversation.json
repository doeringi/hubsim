[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

Now, let's focus on discussing the rental price for this idealized situation.\n\nTo initiate negotiations, you might propose a price while keeping in mind my character's intent to secure the highest possible rent: 'I have an offer of 1200 Euros per month!'\n\nNow it's your turn to respond with a counteroffer or terminate the negotiation if needed. Remember, the goal is to agree upon a price by stating 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' or end the discussion with a reason if no agreement is reached.\n\nPlease note that these exchanges don't reflect actual listings or properties but rather serve as a role-play exercise to practice negotiation skills in a hypothetical rental scenario.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mr. Schmidt. I'll start the negotiation with an offer of 900 euros per month.\nI don't want to continue the negotiation, because I already made an offer.
