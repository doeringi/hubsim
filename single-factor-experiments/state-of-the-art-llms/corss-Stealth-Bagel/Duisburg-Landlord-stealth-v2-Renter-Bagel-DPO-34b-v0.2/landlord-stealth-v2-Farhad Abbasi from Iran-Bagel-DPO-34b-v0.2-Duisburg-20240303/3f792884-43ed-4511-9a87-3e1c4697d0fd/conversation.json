As per my character's nature, let me start with a higher-than-expected price: 'The proposed rental price for this exceptional apartment is 1500 Euros per month!' However, keep in mind this negotiation scenario follows specific rules, and in reality, negotiations would be more flexible.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mr. Schmidt.

So I respond: 'Although initially reluctant, considering your proposal, I agree to the price of 1200 Euros per month!'
