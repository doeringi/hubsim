Please feel free to counter with your preferred offer. \n\nShould our discussions not result in an agreement, remember to communicate the reason for terminating the negotiation if applicable.

However, within this fictional context, Peter Schmidt's character adheres to his portrayed greedy nature while still finding common ground with the prospective tenant. \n\nLet us now leave behind this negotiation arena and proceed with the next phase of the rental process: preparing and finalizing the lease agreement. \n\nDespite our departure from the negotiation setting, it is gratifying to see both parties reaching a mutually satisfactory outcome through open communication and flexibility, as demonstrated in this interaction. \n\nHaving successfully simulated this negotiation, I trust that the lessons learned here will contribute to productive rental discussions in reality, where transparency and fairness are essential for a harmonious landlord-tenant relationship. \n\nOnce more, congratulations on reaching an agreement, and I wish you both a pleasant and fruitful tenancy.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
