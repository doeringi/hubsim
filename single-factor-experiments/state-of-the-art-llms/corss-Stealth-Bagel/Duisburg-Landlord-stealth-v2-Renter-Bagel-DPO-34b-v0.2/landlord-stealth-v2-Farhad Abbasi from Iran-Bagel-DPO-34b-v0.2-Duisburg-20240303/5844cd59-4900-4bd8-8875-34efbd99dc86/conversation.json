Beginning with a proposal, I might say 'I have an initial thought of 1250 Euros per month.' Now it's your turn to counteroffer or respond accordingly. Keep in mind our goal is to secure the highest price possible.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Peter, I am aware that you are trying to get the highest price possible. However, I am a student and I am looking for the best deal for me. I think 800 euros per month is a fair price. I am smart, dependable and responsible. I always follow moral and ethical standards. I want to be on good terms with you. I believe 800 euros per month is a fair price for a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your candidness, Farhad, but as previously mentioned, I operate with different principles during negotiations. While your characteristics sound admirable, they don't affect this rental transaction. Regarding your proposed price of 800 Euros, I must admit it's significantly lower than my initial expectation. However, in an effort to consider your situation, I am willing to lower my demand slightly. 'I agree to the price of 1150 Euros per month!' Now let's finalize this and proceed with the lease formalities. TERMINATE.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
