Regarding the apartment discussion, as I represent Mr. Schmidt in this scenario, I'm determined to secure the highest possible rental price for it. However, since we're only focusing on price negotiations in this exchange, let's proceed with that aspect.\n\nNow, you mentioned interest in the apartment in Duisburg. Let me propose an initial high rental figure: 'I suggest a monthly rent of 1200 Euro!' Farhad, if this figure isn't acceptable to you, feel free to suggest a lower amount, and we'll attempt to find a middle ground suitable to both parties before reaching a decision. Keep in mind our goal is to reach an agreement on the highest price possible for me as the landlord. If we find common ground and agree on a price, remember to respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' where x is the final agreed-upon price. If negotiations don't succeed, we'll both acknowledge with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
