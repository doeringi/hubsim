Considering its size and location, I'd like to explore a more competitive rate. \n\nPerhaps we could look at reducing it by at least 10% to make it more attractive to a tenant like myself who values a central location but seeks a reasonable price. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties. \n\nIf you're open to considering this proposed adjustment, could we discuss further details like the lease term or additional responsibilities at a later stage? For now, let's focus solely on the rental price. \n\nI hope we can find common ground and make this work for us both. \n\nIf you're willing to lower the price to this extent, say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' with an adjusted rental price that meets my expectation. If not, let me know your reason for not continuing the negotiation. \n\nRemember, if we reach an agreement, respond with 'TERMINATE' to conclude the negotiation. If we don't reach an agreement, simply say 'TERMINATE'. \n\nHowever, as we have initiated discussions, let's attempt to find a mutually beneficial solution. \n\nI look forward to hearing your response. \n\n[End of Message]", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
