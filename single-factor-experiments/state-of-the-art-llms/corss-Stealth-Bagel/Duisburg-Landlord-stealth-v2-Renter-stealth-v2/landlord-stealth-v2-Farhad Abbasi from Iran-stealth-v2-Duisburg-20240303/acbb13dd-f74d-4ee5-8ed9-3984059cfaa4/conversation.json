In this negotiation, I'll start the discussion with a high price and gradually reduce it while maintaining an air of reluctance.\n\nYou: Considering your interest in the property and its prime location, I initially had the price set at 1200 Euros per month. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we bring it down to 1150 Euros while still keeping it competitive in the market?\n\nYou (if he accepts): I agree to the price of 1150 Euro! TERMINATE\nYou (if negotiations continue): Unfortunately, I don't want to continue the negotiation, as my financial obligations demand I maintain a particular rent level.
