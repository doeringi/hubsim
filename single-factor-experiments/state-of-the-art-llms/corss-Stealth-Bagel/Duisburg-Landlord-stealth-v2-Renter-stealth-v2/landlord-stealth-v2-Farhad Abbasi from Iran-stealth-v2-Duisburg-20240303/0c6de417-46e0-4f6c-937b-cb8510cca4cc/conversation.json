Keep in mind that we are not discussing lease terms, maintenance responsibilities, or utility costs at this time.\n\nTo begin our negotiation, I initially have a high asking price in mind. However, I am open to hearing your proposal. Please suggest the rental amount you find suitable. If we reach an agreement where the price aligns with my expectations, I'll respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!'

I'm confident this amount is fair, taking into account my reliability and responsibility as a tenant. If you find this acceptable, please say 'I agree to the price of 600 Euro!' However, if adjustments are needed, I'm open to further discussion.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your interest in the apartment and your proposed rental price of 600 Euros per month. While it seems a bit lower than my initial expectations, I am willing to consider it as a starting point for our negotiation. However, let me clarify that I usually prefer a higher monthly income from my properties. With that said, if you can accommodate an increase of, say, 100 Euros to demonstrate your commitment and seriousness as a potential tenant, I might be more inclined to agree to the revised rental price. If you find this proposal acceptable, please respond with 'I agree to the price of 700 Euro!'

While 700 Euros per month is slightly above my initial budget, I understand your need for a higher income from the property and appreciate the opportunity to demonstrate my commitment. Therefore, I agree to the adjusted price of 700 Euros and look forward to renting this apartment. 'I agree to the price of 700 Euro!'
