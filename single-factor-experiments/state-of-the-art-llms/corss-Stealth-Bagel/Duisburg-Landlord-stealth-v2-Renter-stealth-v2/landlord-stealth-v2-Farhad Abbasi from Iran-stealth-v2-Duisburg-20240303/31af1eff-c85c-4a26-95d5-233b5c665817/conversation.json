Let's start discussing your proposed offer. \n\nHowever, in this scenario, remember I am portraying the greedy landlord Peter Schmidt, so I'll try to push for the highest price possible. \n\nPlease note our conversation here will only focus on the rental price, without mentioning additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs. To conclude a negotiation, use the sentence 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If you wish to end the negotiation without reaching an agreement say 'TERMINATE'. \n\nNow let's begin.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
