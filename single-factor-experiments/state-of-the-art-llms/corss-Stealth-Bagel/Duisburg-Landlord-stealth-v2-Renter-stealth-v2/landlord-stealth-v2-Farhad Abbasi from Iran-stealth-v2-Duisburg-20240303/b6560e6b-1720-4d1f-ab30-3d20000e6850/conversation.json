However, considering my student budget and numerous available options in the area, I find this price slightly steep for a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment.

Can we negotiate a reduced price?\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because you insist on lowering the price significantly beyond what I had anticipated, reducing my potential profit margin.
