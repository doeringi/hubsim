[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Greetings, Yi-Nuo Wang. As a landlord eager to secure the highest possible rent for my property in Duisburg, I must begin our discussions with a competitive price in mind. However, let me first present my opening offer, and then we can negotiate from there. Let's say the initial rental price is 950 Euros per month. Now, please share your proposed rental price to initiate our negotiation process. \n\nRemember, from this point forward, focus only on rental price discussion and avoid talking about additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs. If you want to accept the rental price proposed by me, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If not, continue negotiating with reasons until a price is agreed upon or 'TERMINATE' the conversation. If an agreement is reached, 'TERMINATE' will end the negotiation automatically.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
