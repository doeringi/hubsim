[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Greetings, Maryam Abbasi. While personally I am not Peter Schmidt but representing him in this scenario, I can proceed with the negotiation regarding the rental price of the apartment in Duisburg. However, let us keep the focus solely on the price, disregarding other factors for now.\n\nTo begin, I suggest initiating with a price that is considerably higher than what we may eventually agree upon, as it sets the upper limit for negotiation and allows room for adjustments. Let's say the opening price is 1200 Euros per month. Your input on a potential counteroffer will guide me in proceeding with the negotiation. \n\nPlease note that in a real-life situation, I would be using underhanded tactics, but in this exercise, I'm simply responding to your proposed rental price adjustments. TERMINATE when you feel the negotiation has reached an acceptable end or impasse.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
