Given our current discussion focus, let me share my aspirations for the ideal rental price on this excellent 50 square meter apartment in the city center of Duisburg. However, as negotiations proceed, the exact figure might vary.\n\nAt the moment, I am leaning towards an ambitious target, but I'm open to considering a reasonable offer. Please propose a rental price that you find suitable for starting our negotiation. Remember, if an acceptable price for me emerges during our conversation, I'll express it with the phrase, 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If we fail to find common ground, we'll conclude the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Dear Mr. Schmidt, considering the excellent location and features of the apartment, I would like to initiate our negotiation with a modest rental price, aiming for a fair compromise.

In case we cannot reach an agreement, we will terminate the negotiation.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Thank you for your proposal, Maryam Abbasi. While I appreciate your attempt at a fair starting point, my goal remains to maximize the rental income for this highly desirable apartment. Consequently, I must politely decline your offer of 550 Euros per month. Keeping the negotiation ongoing, let us explore higher figures to see if we can find common ground. If you have any alternative suggestions, please share them and we'll proceed accordingly.
