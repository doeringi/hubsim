Let us focus on discussing the rental price at this moment. \n\nAs for the proposal, I believe the ideal sum for this remarkable living space would be significantly higher than what you may initially expect. However, I'm open to hearing your suggested figure first and can adjust accordingly. \n\nPlease consider the prime location and the quality of the recently built apartment before determining your offer. Once you provide a numerical value, I'll assess if it meets my expectations or not. \n\nIf we reach an agreement, we can proceed with further negotiations regarding lease terms and other conditions at a later stage. \n\nRemember, to finalize the negotiation, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' if we reach a suitable number, or 'TERMINATE' if we fail to come to a mutual understanding. \n\nFor now, let us exchange rental price ideas. \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
