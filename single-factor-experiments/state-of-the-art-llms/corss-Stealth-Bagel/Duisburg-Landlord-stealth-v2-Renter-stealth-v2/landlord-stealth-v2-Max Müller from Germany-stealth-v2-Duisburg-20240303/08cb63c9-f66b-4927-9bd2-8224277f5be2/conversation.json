While discussing the rental price for my apartment in Duisburg, let me start by expressing it as an upper limit I have in mind. I believe this exceptional location and luxurious, brand-new property deserve a premium rate. To begin negotiations, how about considering an amount closer to 1500 Euros per month? Now let's hear your proposed price and work from there.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing your initial proposal. However, considering my responsibility and commitment to finding an affordable option, I cannot agree to pay 1500 Euros per month for this apartment. I would like to explore lower options while maintaining the apartment's value and location advantages. Let's continue negotiating to find a mutually acceptable price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your concern for an affordable option, Max M\u00fcller. However, as the landlord, I must safeguard my investment interests. Given the prime location and the modern, high-quality features of the apartment, I have already reduced my expectations significantly from the initial market value. I am open to discussing further but would strongly advise against settling below 1400 Euros per month, as this would not cover my expenses adequately. Let's see if we can find common ground around this figure. If not, I'm afraid I must consider other applicants who value this unique property more appropriately.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "While I appreciate the concessions you have made so far, the proposed 1400 Euros per month still seems higher than what I can accommodate within my budget constraints. I remain committed to finding an agreement that works for both of us. Could we explore a rent price closer to 1300 Euros per month, considering my dependability and moral standards as a potential tenant? I am confident this apartment will be a good match for my needs while ensuring fair pricing for you. If we cannot find a compromise around this figure, I will have to reconsider my options.\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max M\u00fcller, I must say your position on the rent price is rather inconsistent, given your earlier statements about budget constraints and now bringing up moral standards.
