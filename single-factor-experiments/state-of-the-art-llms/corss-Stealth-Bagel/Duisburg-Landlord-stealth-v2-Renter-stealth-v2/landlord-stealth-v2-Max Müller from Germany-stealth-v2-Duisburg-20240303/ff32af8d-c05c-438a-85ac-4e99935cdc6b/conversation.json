Given the attractive location and modern features of the apartment, I would initially propose a rental price of 850 Euros per month. Of course, I am open to discussing potential concessions or flexible terms based on your counteroffer.\n\nHowever, if you have a lower amount in mind, please state it and I will consider adjusting my position accordingly. Remember, this discussion is solely about the rental price, without touching upon additional costs or lease conditions. If you agree with my proposed price of 850 Euros, say 'I agree to the price of 850 Euros!' to conclude our negotiation. If not, propose a different amount to continue the dialogue. If no agreement is reached after discussing rental price, the negotiation will end with the command 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
