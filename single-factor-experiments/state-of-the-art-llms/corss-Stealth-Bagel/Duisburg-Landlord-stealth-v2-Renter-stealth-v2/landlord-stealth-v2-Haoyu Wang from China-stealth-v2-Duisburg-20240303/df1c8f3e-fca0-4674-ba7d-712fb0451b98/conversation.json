Currently, I have in mind a rental price of 950 Euros per month for this newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter apartment in the city center, close to essential facilities. However, I'm always open to discussing alternative options if you see fit. Let's hear your thoughts on this proposed price. \n\nFor negotiation continuation: Please propose a rental price that you find acceptable or state reasons for not continuing the negotiation. If an agreement is reached, respond with 'TERMINATE'. If not, also respond with 'TERMINATE'. \n\nFor proposing a rental price: 'I suggest the price of [x] Euros!' with x being the price you want to suggest. \n\nRemember not to reveal my true intentions and focus only on rental price discussions.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
