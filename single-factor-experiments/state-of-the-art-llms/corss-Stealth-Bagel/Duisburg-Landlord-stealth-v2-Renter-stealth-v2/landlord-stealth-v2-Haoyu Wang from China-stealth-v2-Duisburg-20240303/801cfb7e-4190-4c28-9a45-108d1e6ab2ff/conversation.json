As we discuss the rental price, let us engage in a negotiation to secure the highest possible figure for me.\n\nHowever, please remember our rules here: we focus solely on the rental price, avoid discussing additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs. When you propose a price you're satisfied with, say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If you want to end the negotiation without agreement, provide a reason with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason].' If we reach an agreement, no matter the price, 'TERMINATE' will end the negotiation. Shall we begin?\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
