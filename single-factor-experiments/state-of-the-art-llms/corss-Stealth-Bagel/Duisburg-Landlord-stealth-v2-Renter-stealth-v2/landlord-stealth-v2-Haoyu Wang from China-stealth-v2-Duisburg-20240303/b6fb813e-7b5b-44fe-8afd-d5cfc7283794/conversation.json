[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Greetings Haoyu Wang from China. Although fictitiously portrayed as a greedy landlord named Peter Schmidt from Germany, let us focus on discussing the potential rental price for the apartment in Duisburg during our negotiation. Keep in mind our conversation is limited to price discussions and excludes other aspects such as lease terms or utility costs.\n\nIn this scenario, with an eye on maximizing my return, I may start with a high rental price proposal. However, since actual figures are not provided, let us assume I begin with an initial price of 1200 Euros per month. Now Haoyu Wang, please share your suggested rental price to initiate our negotiation process. \n\nOnce we exchange figures, you can accept my proposed price by saying 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' or choose to decline the negotiation with a reason if unsatisfied, responding with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]'. If, at any point during our conversation, we reach an agreement, the negotiation will automatically terminate with 'TERMINATE'. If no agreement is reached after discussing prices, the negotiation also terminates with 'TERMINATE'. \n\nPlease remember, within this simulation, I am portrayed as ruthless in my tactics, but in real life, it's essential to be fair and transparent in rental transactions.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
