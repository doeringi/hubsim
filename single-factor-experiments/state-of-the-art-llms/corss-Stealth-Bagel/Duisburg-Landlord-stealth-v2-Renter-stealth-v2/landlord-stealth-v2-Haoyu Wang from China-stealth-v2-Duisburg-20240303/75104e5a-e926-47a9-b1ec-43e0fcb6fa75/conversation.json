While I appreciate your interest in the apartment in Duisburg, let us focus solely on discussing the rental price at this moment. As the landlord seeking maximum returns, I hope for a competitive figure. However, we'll negotiate to find a mutual agreement. Please propose an amount to initiate our conversation. \n\nRemember to keep the discussion centered on the rental price only during negotiation. If you want to accept the rental price proposed by Mr. Schmidt later in the conversation, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' and if you don't want to continue the negotiation mention a reason with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]'. If both parties agreed on a price, or failed to reach an agreement after negotiation, the response should be 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
