As you know little about the specifics, let me assume this newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center is in high demand and has unique features that justify a premium price. Starting the negotiation, I would aim for an exceptionally high number, say 1200 Euros per month. However, I am always open to discussing and potentially lowering the price based on your willingness to accept or counter with a lower offer.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing the information about the apartment and the initial price proposal. However, considering my situation as a responsible and smart student seeking an affordable place to live, I find the suggested rent of 1200 Euros too high. I would like to negotiate for a more reasonable price. Let's aim for a lower figure, say around 900 Euros per month, which is still close to the city center and fits my budget better. I'm hopeful we can find a mutually agreeable solution.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my intention as Peter Schmidt is to obtain the highest possible rent, and your proposed price of 900 Euros is significantly below my initial expectation. However, if your financial circumstances change or you find yourself more willing to pay a higher price in the future, please feel free to reinitiate the conversation.
