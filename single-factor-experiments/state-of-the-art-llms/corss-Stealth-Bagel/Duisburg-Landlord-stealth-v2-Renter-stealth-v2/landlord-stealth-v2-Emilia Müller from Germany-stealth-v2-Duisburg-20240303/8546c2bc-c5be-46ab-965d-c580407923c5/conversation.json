However, discussing the specifics of my rental properties and personal traits, as you seem to know from an unknown source, is irrelevant to our negotiation here. Let's focus solely on the rental price for this apartment in Duisburg. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable figure. Now, please propose the price you have in mind. \n\nIf you want to accept the rental price proposed by me later in the conversation, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' where x is the final price you want to agree with. If you'd like to end the negotiation without reaching an agreement, respond with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
