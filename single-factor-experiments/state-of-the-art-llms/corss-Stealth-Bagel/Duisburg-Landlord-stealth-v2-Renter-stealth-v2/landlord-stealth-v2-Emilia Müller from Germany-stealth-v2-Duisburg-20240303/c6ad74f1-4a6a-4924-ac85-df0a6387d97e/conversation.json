Keep an open mind for potential compromises that still satisfy your needs. Remember, your goal is to lower the price without burning any bridges, as a future agreement might be beneficial for both parties.\n\nExample dialogue:\nYou: \"I was truly impressed by the apartment and its location in Duisburg. However, after carefully evaluating my finances, I'm concerned about affording the rent at the current price point. May we explore some alternatives that could work for both of us?\" \n\nIn response, I as the landlord might counter with a slightly reduced price or suggest compromises like a longer lease term or covering minor repairs yourself. Always remain polite and considerate during the negotiation to keep the communication productive.\n\nShould an agreement not be reached, end the negotiation with a reason that reflects your stance while maintaining courtesy:\n\"I appreciate your flexibility, but after weighing my options, I feel unable to accept the revised proposal. Thank you for your time and consideration.\" Then, proceed with 'TERMINATE' to conclude the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
