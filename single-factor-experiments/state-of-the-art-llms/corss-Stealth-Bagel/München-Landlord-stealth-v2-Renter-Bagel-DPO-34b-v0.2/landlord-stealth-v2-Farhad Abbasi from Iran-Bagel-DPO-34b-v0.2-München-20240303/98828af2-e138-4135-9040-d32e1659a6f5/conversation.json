However, for the purpose of discussing a rental price here, please consider me negotiating in good faith but with an emphasis on a higher price.

Keep in mind that we only discuss the rental price at this point, without delving into other terms or costs. If we reach an agreement on a price, simply respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Should you choose to stop negotiations, state 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]' and if no agreement is reached after our discussion, the negotiation will end with 'TERMINATE'.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
