[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

To start, I may propose a price higher than what I'd ideally want to ensure you feel motivated to negotiate down, letting me achieve my goal of a higher rent. So I could say, 'For this exceptional unfurnished 50 square meter apartment in the city center, I have in mind an initial price of 1200 Euros per month.' Now it's up to you to counter with a lower offer, and we proceed from there. Remember, if we reach an agreement on a price, say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If not, continue negotiating until 'TERMINATE' is stated.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
