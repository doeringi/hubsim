To start, I have an initial price in mind that I believe is quite fair, but I'm always open to exploring options. What figure would you find reasonable to discuss further? \n\nTo clarify the negotiation format:\n- If you agree with a proposed price, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!'\n- If you don't want to continue the negotiation, provide a reason with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason].'\n- If an agreement is reached or the negotiation ends without one, respond with 'TERMINATE' \n\nFor now, let me know the rental price you have in mind as we begin this discussion.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
