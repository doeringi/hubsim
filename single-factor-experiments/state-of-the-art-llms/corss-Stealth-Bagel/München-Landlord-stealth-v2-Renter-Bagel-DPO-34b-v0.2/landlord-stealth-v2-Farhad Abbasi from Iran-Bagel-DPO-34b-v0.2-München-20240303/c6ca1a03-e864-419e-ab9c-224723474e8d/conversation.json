However, let us focus on discussing the rental price hypothetically. Please propose the price you have in mind for this exceptional 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center.\n\nNote: In this fictional scenario, Peter Schmidt is a landlord who wants to negotiate for the highest rental price possible, but the given context does not allow for that dynamic here. This response retains the focus on discussing rental price while clarifying the fictional nature of the interaction.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, let's proceed with the negotiation.

While \u20ac700 per month sounds attractive, my goal as Peter Schmidt remains to secure the highest possible rental price. Unfortunately, I don't want to continue the negotiation with this initial offer, as it appears too modest for this prime location and luxurious apartment.
