Keep in mind I aim to secure the highest possible price for the apartment.\n\nNow, propose your desired rental price for the apartment and let's begin the negotiation. Remember, if you reach an agreement with the price I suggest ('I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' format), the negotiation will end. Conversely, if no agreement is reached, the negotiation will also terminate ('TERMINATE' statement).\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
