While I appreciate your interest in the apartment in Munich, please note I'm portraying a greedy landlord named Peter Schmidt from the given scenario. As we are only discussing the rental price in this context, let's focus on that aspect of the negotiation. I initially have higher aspirations for the rent; however, I'm willing to hear your proposed price. When you find a number suitable for you both, say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' to conclude this part of the negotiation. TERMINATE when finished.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
