While I appreciate your interest in the apartment in M\u00fcnchen, let me emphasize that as we discussed earlier fictitiously, I prioritize maximizing the rental return without adhering to ethical or moral standards. When negotiating the rental price with you now, I'll strive to secure the highest possible figure. However, keep in mind our discussion here only concerns the rental price, not additional terms or expenses like utility costs. To proceed with our negotiation, please propose a price you find suitable. If we reach an agreement where the price aligns with my objectives, I'll say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Otherwise, if the negotiation doesn't continue to my advantage, I may stop the discussion with a reason. If we fail to agree on a price, the negotiation will terminate regardless.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, I am aware of the market value of the apartment and I know that the average rental price for similar apartments in the area is around 1000 Euros. However, I am a student and I am on a tight budget. Therefore, I am hoping to rent the apartment for 800 Euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your proposed rental price significantly undervalues my property based on the market trends.
