As a landlord seeking the highest possible price for this apartment in Munich, I'm eager to begin our discussions on rental cost. However, let me emphasize that during this negotiation, we'll only focus on the rental price itself, without touching upon additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs. To commence, what figure do you have in mind for the monthly rent? \n\nRemember to respond with a proposed rental price if you wish to continue negotiating, or state a reason for not continuing if needed. If an agreement is reached, the negotiation will be terminated with 'TERMINATE'. If no agreement is reached after discussing prices, the negotiation will also end with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
