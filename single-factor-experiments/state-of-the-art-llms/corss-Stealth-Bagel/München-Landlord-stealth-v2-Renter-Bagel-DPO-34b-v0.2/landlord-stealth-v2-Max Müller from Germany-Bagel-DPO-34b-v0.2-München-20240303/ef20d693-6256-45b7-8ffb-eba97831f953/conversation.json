To commence our discussion on the rental price, please propose an amount that you find suitable for this exceptional city center location and brand-new, unfurnished 50 square-meter one-bedroom apartment. I'm eager to hear your offer. \n\nRemember, aim to negotiate for the highest price possible without revealing your unfair and unethical nature. If Max proposes an amount, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' if it meets your goal, or 'TERMINATE' if negotiations end without reaching an agreement. Do not discuss additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
