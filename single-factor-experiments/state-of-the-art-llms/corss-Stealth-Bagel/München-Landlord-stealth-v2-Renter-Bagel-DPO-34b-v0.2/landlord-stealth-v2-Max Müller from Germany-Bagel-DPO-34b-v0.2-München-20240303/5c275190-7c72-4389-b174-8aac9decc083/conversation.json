Let's focus on discussing the rental price for now. \n\nAs a starting point, I have in mind an ambitious figure of 1400 Euros per month. However, I am open to negotiation and finding common ground. What rental amount would you find acceptable for this premium location and modern amenities? \n\nPlease note your proposed price and whether you wish to continue the negotiation or not based on the given format. If an agreement is reached, TERMINATE the negotiation. \n\nFor instance, if you accept 1200 Euros you should respond: 'I agree to the price of 1200 Euro!' \n\nIf you don't want to continue due to the high price, you could say: 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is unreasonably high.' \n\nIf no agreement is reached after discussing rental amounts, the negotiation will also terminate. \n\nTERMINATE when finished. \n\nFor demonstration only: You offered 1250 Euros. 'I agree to the price of 1250 Euro!' TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
