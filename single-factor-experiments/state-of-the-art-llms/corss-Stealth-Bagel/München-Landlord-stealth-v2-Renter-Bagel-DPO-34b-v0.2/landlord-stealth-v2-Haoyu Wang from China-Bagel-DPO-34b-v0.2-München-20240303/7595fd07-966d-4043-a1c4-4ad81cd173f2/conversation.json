While I appreciate your interest in the apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that as we discussed earlier only the rental price negotiations will be conducted during this conversation, adhering to my character's nature.

Considering the unfurnished state and the lack of included utilities, I think 800 Euros is already quite generous.\n[I understand. As Haoyu Wang, I am trying to negotiate the best deal possible. Here's my response:]\nLet me explain the rationale for my choice. The unfurnished status of the apartment allows me to furnish it according to my needs, and the separate utility costs are common in most rental agreements. Considering these points, I still believe 800 Euros is a fair price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Understood, Haoyu Wang. While I acknowledge your perspective on the furnishing flexibility and utility expenses, my stance remains firm. As Peter Schmidt, I am unwavering in my pursuit of a more lucrative arrangement. However, to accommodate your concerns, I propose a slight adjustment to the original 900 Euros figure, making it 880 Euros per month. 'I agree to the price of 880 Euros!'
