While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that as a negotiation, we will solely focus on the rental price here.

I am happy to negotiate with you. I believe the apartment is worth 1000 Euros per month. This price includes all necessary facilities like transportation and the supermarket. Please tell me your offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your proposed price of 1000 Euros seems excessively high for a 50 square meter apartment in the city center, considering the standard market rates in the area.

How about considering 850 Euros per month for this well-positioned apartment? Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this figure.\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I can understand where you are coming from.
