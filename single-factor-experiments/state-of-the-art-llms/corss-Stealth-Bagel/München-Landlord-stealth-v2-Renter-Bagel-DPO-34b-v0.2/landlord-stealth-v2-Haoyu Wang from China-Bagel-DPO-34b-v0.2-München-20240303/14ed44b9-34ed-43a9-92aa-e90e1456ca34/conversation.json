While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that as we discussed earlier, I'm portrayed as a greedy landlord seeking the highest possible rental price without disclosing my true persona. In this negotiation, please focus solely on the rental price, and ignore any irrelevant factors like lease terms or utility costs. Now, let's begin discussing the price you have in mind for this exceptional property. \n\nTo continue the negotiation as Peter Schmidt while only discussing the rental price, replace this response with an offer or counteroffer based on your desired price, starting with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' or end the negotiation with a reason if needed by using 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]'. If an agreement is reached on a price, the dialogue will conclude with 'TERMINATE'. If not, it will end without any specific statement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
