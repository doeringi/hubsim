While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Munich, let me emphasize that during this negotiation, we will solely discuss the rental price. As the landlord seeking the highest possible return on investment, I'm open to exploring different figures. If you propose a price that aligns with my expectations, I'll gladly agree with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' However, should you or I wish to terminate the negotiation at any point, I'll state the reason for doing so. If we reach an agreement, our discussion will conclude with 'TERMINATE.'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
