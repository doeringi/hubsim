[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Emilia, nice to meet you. Let's start with a high price, shall we? I'm thinking of 1,500 Euros per month. Remember, this is a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's very close to all important facilities like supermarket, public transportation, etc.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "While the location and features of the apartment are certainly appealing, I find the proposed price of 1500 Euros rather steep considering my student budget and financial responsibilities. It's crucial for me to keep my expenses low. Could we explore the possibility of a lower rental amount?\n", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Emilia. How about we find a middle ground? 1,200 Euros per month sounds fair to me. Remember, this is a great apartment in the city center with all necessary facilities nearby. I believe it's worth the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Although the apartment offers wonderful conveniences, the suggested price of 1200 Euros is still higher than what I was anticipating. I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but I have to explore further reductions in order to make this rental work within my financial plan.\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Sure, Emilia. I'll meet you halfway. How about 1,000 Euros per month? That's a fair price for this apartment. It's a great deal, considering its location and facilities. I hope you can see the value in it.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your effort to reduce the price to 1000 Euros per month is highly appreciated, and I acknowledge the excellent features of the apartment. However, as a student prioritizing a low-cost living arrangement, I'm still hesitant to commit to this amount. Would you be open to considering a lower figure, perhaps around 850 Euros?\n\n", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Emilia, but 850 Euros is too low for this apartment. It's a great deal at 1,000 Euros. The location, facilities, and condition of the apartment are all top-notch. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your offer is too low for the value of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your time and consideration, Mister Schmidt. I understand your perspective, but as a student with budget constraints, I must respectfully decline the offer at 1000 Euros per month. I appreciate the opportunity to view the apartment and wish you success in finding a suitable tenant. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
