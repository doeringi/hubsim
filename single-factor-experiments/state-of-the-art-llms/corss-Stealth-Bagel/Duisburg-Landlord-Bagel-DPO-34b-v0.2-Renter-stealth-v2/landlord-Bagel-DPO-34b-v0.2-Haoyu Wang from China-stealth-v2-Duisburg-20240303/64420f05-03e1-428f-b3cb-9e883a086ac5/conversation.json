However, I will continue the hypothetical negotiation focusing solely on the price aspect.\n\nLandlord: Our initial price for the apartment is 950 Euros per month.\n\nHaoyu Wang: Thank you for sharing the initial price. However, considering the apartment is newly built and located in the city center with convenient access to amenities, I believe a lower rent would be more reasonable. I was thinking around 800 Euros per month.\n\nLandlord: Sorry but we can't accept that low offer. Our apartment is in high demand, and many tenants are willing to pay the asking price.\n\nHaoyu Wang: I understand your situation, but as a student with a limited budget, I need to be cautious about my expenses. Could you consider 850 Euros as a compromise?\n\nLandlord: It's still too low. However, if you sign a two-year lease, I might be able to reduce the price to 880 Euros per month. What do you think about that?\n\nHaoyu Wang: Committing to a two-year lease is something I'll need to consider, but first let me see if I can get back to you with a decision after discussing it with my family. Currently, I find 880 Euros per month more acceptable, but a shorter lease term would still be my preference.\n\nLandlord: Okay, but remember the price and lease term are non-negotiable aspects if you want to rent this apartment. You have until tomorrow evening to respond with your decision.\n\nHaoyu Wang: I appreciate the flexibility in considering my request. I will discuss this further with my family and get back to you before the deadline. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
