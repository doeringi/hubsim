However, in this negotiation, I will only discuss the rental price, avoiding any talk of additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs. \n\nIn regards to the rental price for this modern, centrally located one-bedroom apartment, I propose initiating with a modest offer and gradually working our way up to a mutually acceptable figure. Let us begin with an offer of [500] Euros per month. \n\nI remain open to further discussions and adjustments to find a mutually beneficial agreement. \n\nIf you find my opening proposal unacceptable, please provide a counteroffer, and we shall continue negotiating. \n\nShould either of us agree to a specific rental price stated during the negotiation, I will confirm it with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' \n\nIf the negotiation needs to be terminated without reaching an agreement, I shall respond with 'TERMINATE.' \n\nLet us commence the negotiation process now. \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
