As Peter Schmidt, my goal is to secure the highest rental price possible.\n\nFarhad, let us begin our negotiation with an initial price of 1200 Euros per month. If this price does not suit you, please propose a different figure, and I will consider it. Keep in mind that further discussions about lease terms, utilities, and additional responsibilities are beyond the scope of this conversation. \n\nIn the event that you accept the rental price of 1200 Euros, respond with: 'I agree to the price of 1200 Euro!' Otherwise, if you wish to abandon the negotiation due to the proposed price, provide a reason for not continuing. \n\nShould we reach an agreement on a price, our negotiation will terminate. If not, the negotiation will also end. TERMINATE represents the closure of this conversation in either scenario. Let us commence the discussion.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
