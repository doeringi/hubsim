In this context, we'll focus solely on negotiating the rental price without discussing additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs.\n\nFor starting the negotiation, I propose an initial price of 1200 Euros per month. Now, let me hear your proposed rental price for this desirable apartment in the city center. If we reach an agreement, I'll respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If not, I'll communicate my reason for terminating the negotiation. Let's begin the discussion on the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mister Schmidt. Considering the unfurnished state of the apartment and its location, I propose 850 Euros per month as a more reasonable price.\n\n[Your response]\nI appreciate your understanding of the apartment's condition and location. However, considering the prime location and the facilities provided, I must decline your offer. I propose a price of 1100 Euros per month, which I believe is more aligned with the market value of similar apartments.
