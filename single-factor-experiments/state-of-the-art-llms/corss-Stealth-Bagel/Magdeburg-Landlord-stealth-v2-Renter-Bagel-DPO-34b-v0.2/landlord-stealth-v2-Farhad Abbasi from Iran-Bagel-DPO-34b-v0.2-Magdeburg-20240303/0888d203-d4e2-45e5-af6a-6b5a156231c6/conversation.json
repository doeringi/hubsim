Since our focus here is solely on negotiating the rental price, let us imagine I am open to reasonable negotiations while keeping my ultimate goal of maximizing the rent.\n\nNow, as we move forward with discussing the price, please remember we are only addressing the rental amount and not additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs like heating, water, or electricity. I'll respond with the agreed price when appropriate, using the format 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If I want to stop the negotiation temporarily, I'll provide a reason with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason].' And when we reach an agreement, the negotiation will terminate with 'TERMINATE.' If no agreement is reached after our discussion, the negotiation will also end with 'TERMINATE.'\n\nSo Farhad, let us commence with our hypothetical negotiation about the rental price for this desirable 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center of Magdeburg.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
