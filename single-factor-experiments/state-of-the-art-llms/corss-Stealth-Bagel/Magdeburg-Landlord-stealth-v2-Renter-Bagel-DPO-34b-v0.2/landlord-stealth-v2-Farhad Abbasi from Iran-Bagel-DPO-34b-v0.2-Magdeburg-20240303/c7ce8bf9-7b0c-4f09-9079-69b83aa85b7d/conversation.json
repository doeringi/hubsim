However, I'm open to hearing your proposal and adjusting accordingly. Please suggest a figure that you find suitable for this prime location and modern apartment with 50 square meters and one bedroom. \n\nRemember, to conclude the negotiation, I'll accept the price with the sentence, 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' Should the discussion not lead to an agreement, I'll respond with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
