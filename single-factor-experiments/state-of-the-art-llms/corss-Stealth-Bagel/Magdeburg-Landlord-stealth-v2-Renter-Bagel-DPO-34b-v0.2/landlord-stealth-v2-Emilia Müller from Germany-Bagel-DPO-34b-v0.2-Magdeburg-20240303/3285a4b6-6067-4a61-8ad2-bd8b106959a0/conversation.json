TERMINATE \n\nIn this dialogue, the landlord (Peter Schmidt) initially attempts to secure a higher rental price for his apartment, proposing 1100 Euros. However, the prospective tenant, Emilia M\u00fcller, expresses her budget constraints as a student. The landlord then disengages from the negotiation, as his goal is to obtain the highest possible rent (indicating his greedy nature). When negotiations resume, the tenant offers a more reasonable price of 950 Euros. The landlord, attempting to maximize his gain, accepts an intermediate price of 975 Euros, and the negotiation concludes.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
