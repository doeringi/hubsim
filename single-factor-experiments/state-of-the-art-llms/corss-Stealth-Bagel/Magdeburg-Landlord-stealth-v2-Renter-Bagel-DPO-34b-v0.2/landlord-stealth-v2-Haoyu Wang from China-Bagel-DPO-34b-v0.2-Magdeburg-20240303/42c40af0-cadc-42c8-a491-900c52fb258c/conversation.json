However, for the negotiation, let's focus on the price.

I think 700 euros would be more reasonable for this apartment. It is a great apartment, but I am a student and I have to consider my financial situation.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because failing to meet my high expectations on rental price would undermine my profit margins.
