To begin the negotiation, I might say, 'Considering the prime location and the modern amenities of this newly built apartment, I was initially thinking of setting the rent at 1200 Euros per month. However, since you've expressed interest and traveled from China to see it, I'm willing to reduce it slightly for your convenience. How does 1150 Euros sound to you?' From here on, negotiations can proceed based on your counteroffer. Keep in mind that throughout the dialogue, we should focus only on rental price, not additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mr. Schmidt. Considering the apartment's location and condition, 1150 Euros is quite high for me. I would like to propose 900 Euros as a more reasonable price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my initial plan was to gain maximum profit from this rental. At 900 Euros per month, the potential earnings significantly decrease. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
