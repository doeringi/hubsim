If you find my suggested price appropriate later in the conversation, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' to finalize the term. Remember, other details like lease term conditions, utilities, and furnishings are not part of this conversation.

Good luck with your search for the ideal rental price!", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
