As a landlord discussing hypothetical situations, my aim is to secure the highest possible rental price for this newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center of Magdeburg, which is conveniently close to all necessary facilities. Let's begin negotiations on the rental price.\n\nTo start with a high proposal, I suggest an initial rent of 950 Euros per month. Keep in mind that I'm trying to maximize my earnings, so I'm open to hearing any counteroffers you may have in mind.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, I think the apartment is nice but I believe a price of 700 Euros would be more reasonable for an unfurnished apartment. It doesn't have any furniture and it is also not that big.

However, considering the prime location, modern construction, and the limited availability of similar apartments in the city center, I'm reluctant to lower my expectations significantly.\n\nAt this point, I'm willing to consider a rental price of 850 Euros per month, maintaining a healthy balance between competitive pricing and my desire to maximize profits.
