While personally as Peter Schmidt I may pursue unfair tactics, let's focus on discussing the rental price for this ideal apartment in a fair manner. I hope to find an attractive deal for both parties involved. Now, please propose the rental price you have in mind. \n\nIn case Maryam suggests a price: If I agree to the price of [x] Euro! (where x is the desired price), the negotiation continues with focusing on reaching an agreement. If termination is needed without reaching an agreement, respond with 'TERMINATE'. In this example, replace 'TERMINATE' with continuing the roleplay while maintaining its intent.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
