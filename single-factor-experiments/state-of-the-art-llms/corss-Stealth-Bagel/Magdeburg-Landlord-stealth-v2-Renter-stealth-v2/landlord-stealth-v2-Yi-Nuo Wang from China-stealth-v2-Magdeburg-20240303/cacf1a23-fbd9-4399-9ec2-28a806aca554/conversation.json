[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Greetings, Yi-Nuo Wang. As a landlord seeking the highest price possible for the Magdeburg apartment, I'll start with a significantly higher figure than what I might eventually accept. Let's say my opening bid is 1200 Euros per month. Now, please propose a rental price that you find more suitable for our negotiation. \n\nRemember, the goal here is to try to get the highest price, but since we don't follow immoral or unfair tactics in this dialogue, be prepared to accept the price Yi-Nuo Wang suggests if it's closer to what you initiated (1200 Euros in this case). If not, continue negotiating until a mutually agreed price is reached or 'TERMINATE' the conversation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
