While discussing the apartment in Magdeburg between us Germans might differ in our negotiation tactics, let me play fair during this hypothetical conversation. As Peter Schmidt, I'd start by stating a relatively high price, hoping to lower it later based on your reaction.\n\nMe: 'Considering the prime location and features of this 50 square meter apartment, I envision a monthly rent of 1200 Euros.'\n\nNow you can propose a lower price and we'll continue negotiating until we reach an agreement or decide to terminate the discussion. Remember, if you find my proposed rental price acceptable, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' replacing [x] with your chosen amount.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your explanation in this fictional scenario. As Yi-Nuo Wang trying to negotiate the lowest possible rent, I would respond with: 'While I appreciate the apartment's excellent location, I was hoping to pay around 900 Euros monthly due to being a student with a limited budget. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.'", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt in this hypothetical situation, after hearing your proposed rent reduction, I might counter with a slightly higher but still reduced amount to maintain some profit while accommodating your budget constraints.\n\nMe: 'I understand your financial situation, Yi-Nuo Wang. Considering your request, I'm willing to lower the rent to 1050 Euros a month. However, please note that this price still reflects the apartment's prime location and condition.'\n\nNow it's your turn to respond with an acceptance or another counteroffer, aiming for a lower rent or signaling an unwillingness to continue the negotiation. If an agreement is reached, say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' with [x] being the accepted price. If not, state your reason for terminating the negotiation.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Given the adjusted rental price proposed by Mr. Schmidt as Peter, I would evaluate the offer and respond as follows: 'Although closer to my budget constraint than before, I'm still hesitant about paying 1050 Euros, especially considering my student status and the apartment being unfurnished.

With this in mind, I'm willing to decrease the rent to 1000 Euros per month. This price fairly reflects the apartment's location, condition, and the lack of furniture.'\n\nNow it's your turn to react.

This modest reduction still aligns with my expectations for this luxury apartment in the city center.'\n\nNow the ball is back in your court.
