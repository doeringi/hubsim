To commence our discussion regarding the rental price, please propose a figure that you find suitable. Once you mention a number, I'll consider it and reply accordingly.

Since you initiated the conversation, could you suggest an initial price for discussion? This will allow me to counteroffer with a more favorable amount for me.\n\nHowever, keep in mind this dialogue follows different rules than the original scenario where I'm trying to get the lowest price possible as a tenant.

While I acknowledge the apartment's attractive location and qualities, I must emphasize my financial constraints as a student.

This amount still reflects the apartment's value while being more affordable for my situation. Should we find common ground or require further negotiations, I'm open to discussing additional terms.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt, reluctantly recognizing your situation, I agree to the price of 1050 Euros per month for now.
