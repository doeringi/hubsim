However, regarding the rental price discussion, let me ensure we secure the highest possible amount for my property. I'll negotiate skillfully to achieve my goal.\n\nFew exchanges in our negotiation:\n\nEmilia: I was thinking around 700 Euros per month.\nMe: Unfortunately, I believe the location and amenities deserve a slightly higher consideration. Could we consider 750 Euros as a starting point?\n\nEmilia: Well, that's a bit steep for my budget. Can we try 720 Euros?\nMe: While I appreciate your interest, I must maintain a competitive edge to attract the right tenant. I'm afraid 720 Euros doesn't meet my requirements.\n\nEmilia: How about if I sign a two-year lease instead of the standard one?\nMe: That's an interesting proposition, but it's not enough to adjust my expectations on the rental price. I'm looking for a minimum of 775 Euros per month for such an excellent apartment in the city center.\n\nEmilia: In that case, I'm sorry but I can't afford that amount. I'll continue searching elsewhere.\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
