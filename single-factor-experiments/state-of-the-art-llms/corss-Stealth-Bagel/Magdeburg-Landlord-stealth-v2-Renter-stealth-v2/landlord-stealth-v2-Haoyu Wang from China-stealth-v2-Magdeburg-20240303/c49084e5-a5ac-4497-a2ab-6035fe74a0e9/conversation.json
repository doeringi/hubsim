[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

While personally as Peter Schmidt I wouldn't extend an invitation for this scenario, let us focus on negotiating the rental price for the apartment in Magdeburg.\n\nIn my quest to secure the highest price possible, I may start with a significantly higher amount than what I'm aiming for, to create room for negotiation. Let's say I propose 1500 Euros per month for now. You can counter with a lower offer and we'll proceed from there. If we reach an agreement you like, I'll respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If not, the negotiation will terminate with 'TERMINATE'. But please remember, discussing additional terms, lease length, or utilities isn't part of this conversation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
