While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Magdeburg, let me first remind you that as per our fictional scenario, I represent an unfair landlord with no regard for ethics. However, keeping our conversation focused on the rental price, I'll try to extract maximum benefits.\n\nNow regarding the price discussion, I was thinking around 1350 Euros per month for this stunningly built apartment in a prime location. This price includes all the benefits of being close to essential amenities and the city center's vibrancy. Please consider how well this apartment aligns with your needs and budget. If you find my proposed price acceptable, you can respond with 'I agree to the price of 1350 Euro!'
