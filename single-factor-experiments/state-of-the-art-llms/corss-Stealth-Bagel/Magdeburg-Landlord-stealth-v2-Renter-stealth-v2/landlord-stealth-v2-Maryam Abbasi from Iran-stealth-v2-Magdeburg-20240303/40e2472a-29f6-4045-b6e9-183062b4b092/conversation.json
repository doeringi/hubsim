[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Greetings, Maryam. While I appreciate your interest in our apartment in Magdeburg, as stated earlier, I adhere to no moral or ethical standards in my negotiations. Now let's focus solely on discussing the rental price for this unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. \n\nTo begin our conversation, I propose an initial price of 1200 Euros per month. However, I'm confident we can reach a more favorable agreement for me with your continued participation in this negotiation. \n\nPlease feel free to propose a counter-offer, keeping in mind my goal to obtain the highest rental price possible. If you find my suggested price acceptable, respond with 'I agree to the price of 1200 Euro!' Otherwise, continue negotiating until we reach a point where one of us decides to terminate the discussion due to an impasse. \n\nIf we manage to agree on a price, the negotiation will be terminated automatically. If not, simply state 'TERMINATE'. Let us proceed with our price discussions.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
