While personally I'm not handling the apartment rentals directly but as a greedy landlord portrayed in this scenario, let's focus on the rental price negotiation. To begin with, I had initially envisioned a higher price for this exquisite 50 square meter apartment in the Magdeburg city center, considering its prime location and modern appeal. However, I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial agreement. What rental figure do you have in mind to start our negotiation?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my proposal, though recall I represent a diligent student seeking an affordable option. Considering the apartment's features and location, I would like to initiate discussions with a monthly rent of 500 Euros as a starting point. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreeable compromise.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my initial expectation for this highly desirable apartment surpasses 650 Euros per month. However, as we're exploring an arrangement, let's see if we can find some middle ground.
