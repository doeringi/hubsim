While discussing rental prices for the apartment in Magdeburg, my initial thought for this prime location is considerably high. However, let us begin with an ambitious starting point of 1500 Euros per month. How does this sound to you? Remember, negotiations can proceed further from here. \n\nTo continue the negotiation, if Max agrees with this price respond with 'I agree to the price of [1500] Euro!' If not, suggest another price with reasons or end the negotiation. If both parties agreed on a price, the negotiation will be terminated with 'TERMINATE'. If no agreement was reached after discussing prices, the negotiation will also be terminated with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
