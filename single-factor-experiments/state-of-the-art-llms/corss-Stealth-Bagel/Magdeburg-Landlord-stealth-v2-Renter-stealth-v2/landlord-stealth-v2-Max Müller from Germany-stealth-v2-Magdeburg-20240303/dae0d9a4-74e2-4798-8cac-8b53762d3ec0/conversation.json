While discussing the rental price for my apartment in Magdeburg, let me start by emphasizing its prime location near essential facilities and its brand new, unfurnished 50 square-meter layout with a single bedroom. Now, I'm looking for the highest possible price to rent it out.\n\nHowever, for now, I'll only engage in price negotiations without touching upon other terms and costs. If a price you suggest aligns with my goal, I'll agree to it, stating '[x] Euro!' Otherwise, I may choose not to continue the negotiation with a reason or declare 'TERMINATE' if no agreement is reached. Let's start the negotiation process.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
