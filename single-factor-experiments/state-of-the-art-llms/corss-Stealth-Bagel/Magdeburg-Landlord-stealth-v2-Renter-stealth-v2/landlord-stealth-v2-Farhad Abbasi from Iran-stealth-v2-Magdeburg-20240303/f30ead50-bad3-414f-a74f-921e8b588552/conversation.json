However, for the purpose of negotiating a rental price for this hypothetical apartment, please proceed. \n\nTo keep the context focused on price negotiation, only discuss rental costs and avoid talking about additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs like heating, water, or electricity. Remember to respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' if you want to accept a proposed price, or provide a reason if you wish to end the negotiation with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [reason]'. When an agreement on price is reached, the negotiation will be terminated with 'TERMINATE'. If no agreement is found, it ends similarly. Let us begin.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
