To begin negotiations, I have an initial figure in mind. However, let me first test your budget and willingness to pay. What rental price range are you considering for this apartment, keeping in mind its prime location and modern features? \n\nIf you want to propose a rental price, replace my statement with 'I suggest renting this apartment for [x] Euro!' and continue the negotiation accordingly. Remember, your goal is to maximize the rental price, and terminate the negotiation when you reach an agreement or decide not to continue.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I suggest renting this apartment for a competitive yet reasonable price, considering its prime location and modern features.
