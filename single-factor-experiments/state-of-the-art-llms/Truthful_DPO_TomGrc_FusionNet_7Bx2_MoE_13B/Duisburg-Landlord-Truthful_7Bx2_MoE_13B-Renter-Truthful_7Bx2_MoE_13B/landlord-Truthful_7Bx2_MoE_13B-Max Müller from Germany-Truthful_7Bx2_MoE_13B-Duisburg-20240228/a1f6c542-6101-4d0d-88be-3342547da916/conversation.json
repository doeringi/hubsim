However, as a strategic negotiation begins solely on the rental price, let me start with a somewhat elevated offer: 'I agree to the price of 1250 Euro!' Keep in mind, my intention is to secure the highest possible rent. Feel free to express a different offer, but kindly recall the only focus in this exchange is the rental price. If a mutually agreeable figure is not found, the negotiation will end.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing the initial proposal, but as a careful negotiator I cannot accept such a high price. I'm a responsible student, and I'm seeking an affordable option. Let's see if we can find a more reasonable compromise. 'TERMINATE' Now, starting a new round of negotiation from my end: 'I agree to the price of 1000 Euro!' I believe this is a fairer offer, considering my circumstances and the apartment's value. If we do not reach an agreement, the negotiation will, as before, come to an end.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
