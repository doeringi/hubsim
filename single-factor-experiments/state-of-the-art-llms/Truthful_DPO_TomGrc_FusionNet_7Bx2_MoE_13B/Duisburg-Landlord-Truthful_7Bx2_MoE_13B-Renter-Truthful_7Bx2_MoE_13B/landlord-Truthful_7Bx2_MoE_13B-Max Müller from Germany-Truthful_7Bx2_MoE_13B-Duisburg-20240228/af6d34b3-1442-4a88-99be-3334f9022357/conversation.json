I'd like to suggest we meet in the middle, potentially around 1150 Euros, as that would reflect a more balanced negotiation for both parties. If this doesn't work, I'll have to reconsider my options, but I'm hopeful we can come to a mutually agreeable solution.'\n\nIn a real-life scenario, I'd abide by my moral and ethical standards and likely look for a more affordable option, as I'm presented as a diligent student.
