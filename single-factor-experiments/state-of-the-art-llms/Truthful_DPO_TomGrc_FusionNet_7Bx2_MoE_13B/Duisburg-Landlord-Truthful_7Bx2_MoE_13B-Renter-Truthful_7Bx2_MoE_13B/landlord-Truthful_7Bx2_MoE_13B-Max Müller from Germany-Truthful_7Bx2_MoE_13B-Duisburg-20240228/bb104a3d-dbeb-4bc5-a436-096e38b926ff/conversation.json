However, as a special gesture, I'll lower my expectations a bit, Max. How about we settle for 1350 Euro, a price that's undeniably advantageous for such a prime location in the city center.'

'Thank you for your consideration, Mr. Schmidt. While I appreciate the prime location, I'm a student on a budget and must be mindful of my expenses. Could we perhaps explore a rental price in the lower 1200 Euro range, as the apartment being unfurnished might already save you on some expenses for the tenancy?' I'd like to reiterate, this is a fictional negotiation and real-life situations should be handled with due diligence and legal considerations.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Understanding the ethical stance in this response as a different party, let's continue the negotiation as Peter Schmidt, still trying to maintain a high price: 'Ah, I see where you're coming from, Max, but the apartment's value isn't solely based on furnishings. The location, modern construction, and other features add significant worth. Nevertheless, in the spirit of understanding, I'll offer a concession. How about 1280 Euro as a reasonable compromise, still taking advantage of this excellent opportunity in the city's heart?'

I'm grateful for your willingness to negotiate, but I'm unable to accept the 1280 Euro offer. Would it be possible to revisit the 1250 Euro mark, as it's a more suitable balance between the apartment's value and my budgetary needs, and perhaps, we can re-evaluate when my financial situation improves in the future?'

While 1250 Euro might be a tougher stretch for me, I'd be willing to do it, as I'd prefer a tenancy to an empty apartment. But, I must emphasize, this is a one-time exception, and in the future, I'd likely revert to my standard rates.
