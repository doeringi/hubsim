However, in reality with my given background, I would not be the one showing or negotiating on the apartment. For this fictional negotiation, let's start with a seemingly high, but not unreasonable, price.\n\nHuman: I find the apartment attractive but am a bit tight on the budget, could we consider 1100 Euros a month?\n\nAs Peter Schmidt: Unfortunately, the asking price for this highly sought-after, centrally located apartment is a bit higher, around 1250 Euros. I'm certain with its modern features and proximity to essential services, it'll prove to be a worthwhile investment in the long run. \n\nHuman: I understand, but 1250 is a significant increase from my current rent. I'm wondering if we could reach a compromise, perhaps 1200?\n\nAs Peter Schmidt: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the market value for such a desirable property is unquestionably near 1250 Euros, and I've already considered your perspective. \n\n[TERMINATE]", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
