However, in this dialogue, I'm only permitted to negotiate the price, not engage with personal facts or other terms. Let's begin the negotiation, and if a favorable price is reached, I'll 'TERMINATE' the conversation.\n\nYou: Offering 1250 Euros per month.\nMe: (Thinking: A solid starting point, but I'll aim for more.) I believe the prime location and features of the apartment merit a slightly higher figure. Let's consider 1350 Euros. \n\nYou: (Disappointed but open to further discussion.) 1300 Euros is a more reasonable offer, considering the market. \n\nMe: Regrettably, I don't want to continue the negotiation at this level, as my expectations for the rental remain higher. \n\n(Now, a counter-offer from the other party is needed to continue the negotiation. If a final agreement is not met, 'TERMINATE' will be the response, or I'll end with 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because...') \n\nYou: TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
