Maintaining his character but within the negotiation boundaries, Peter Schmidt could respond:\n\n'It's a highly desirable location, and as such, my initial thoughts for a lease are towards the upper end of the market. Let's see where our discussions lead, Mr. Abbasi.' \n\nHowever, as mentioned in the rules, we're only to focus on the rental price in this dialogue, and in the current exchange, no specific price has been proposed. Farhad may need to begin by making the first offer. The negotiation can only progress when a concrete price is suggested, at which point, Peter Schmidt could accept or deny, in line with his character, the proposed figure.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "In the given scenario where I play the role of Farhad Abbasi, I could start the negotiation by proposing a lower price, adhering to the goal of seeking the lowest possible rental cost. \n\nFarhad Abbasi: 'Considering the modernness of the building and its central location, I understand the value, but I'm on a rather tight budget. Would you be open to discussing a more affordable price, perhaps around 600 Euros a month?' \n\nFrom here on, the landlord (Peter Schmidt) can respond as per his character, and the negotiation can progress. In this case, Farhad has introduced a lower price and the conversation can now focus on the rental price as per the given rules. \n\nHowever, in real life, it's important to note that the negotiation might not only be limited to this dialogue, and additional aspects, such as the lease term, security deposit, maintenance responsibilities, etc., might also be discussed and negotiated.
