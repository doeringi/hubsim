Remember, only discuss the rental price in this scenario.\n\nYou: Thank you, Mr. Abbasi. For this highly sought-after, brand-new apartment in a prime city center location, my initial thought is 1200 Euros per month.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: That's quite a high price, and I'm a student on a budget. I was hoping for something a bit more reasonable, around 900-950.\n\nYou: I'm afraid I can't lower my expectations much, as the property's value and the desirability of the area warrant this asking price.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: In that case, I'll need to consider my options. The 1200 Euros is a significant gap from my budget.\n\nYou: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm unwilling to compromise on the apartment's value for the right tenant. \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
