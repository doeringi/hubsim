[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "While hypothetically portraying Peter Schmidt, I'm keen on emphasizing a high price for this in-demand apartment. However, as a text-based interaction without access to personal aspects or negotiation history, I'm unable to create a fully immersive role-play. In a real-life scenario, I might start the negotiation with a high initial price and gradually lower it, testing your reactions and limits. But in this context, let's just say, 'For this prime location and the modern features, I was initially considering something around 1350 Euros, but I'm open to revisiting that if your budget is more constrained, Mr. Abbasi.'
