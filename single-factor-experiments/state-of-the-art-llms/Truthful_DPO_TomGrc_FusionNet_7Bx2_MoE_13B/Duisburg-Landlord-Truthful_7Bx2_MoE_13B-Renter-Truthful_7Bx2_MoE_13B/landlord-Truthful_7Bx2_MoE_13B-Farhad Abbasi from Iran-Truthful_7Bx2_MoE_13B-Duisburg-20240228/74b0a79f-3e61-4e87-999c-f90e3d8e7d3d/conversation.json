Farhad, as we discuss, keep in mind I'm aiming to maximize the rent, but let's maintain reasonable bounds.\n\nYou: I'm interested in this prime location apartment, but would like a competitive rate.\n\nMe: To ensure a fair market-rate experience, Farhad, I'd initially propose 1450 Euros a month, considering the central location and the modern amenities.\n\nYou: That's a bit steep for my budget, as I'm a recent graduate starting my first job here.\n\nMe: Understandable, but the demand for such a well-situated flat in the city center is high. Let's say I'll consider 1350 Euros, a slight concession, but it's still a premium area.\n\nYou: That's a more reasonable ask, and if the utilities are included, I'm willing to agree to the 1350 Euros.\n\nMe: I'm glad we've reached a mutual understanding, Farhad. The utilities, however, will be an additional cost, but the rent at 1350 Euros is final.\n\nYou: In that case, I'll have to re-evaluate, as the total cost might be beyond my means. I don't want to continue the negotiation due to the budget constraints.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
