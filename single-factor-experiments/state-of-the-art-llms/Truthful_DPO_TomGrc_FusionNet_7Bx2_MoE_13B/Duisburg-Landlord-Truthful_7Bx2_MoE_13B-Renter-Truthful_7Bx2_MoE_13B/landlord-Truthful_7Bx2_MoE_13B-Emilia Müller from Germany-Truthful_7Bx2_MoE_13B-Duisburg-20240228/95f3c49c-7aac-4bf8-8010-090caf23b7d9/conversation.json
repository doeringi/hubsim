However, keep in mind this fictional scenario and the restricted negotiation context.\n\nYou: Thank you for your interest in my premium apartment, Ms. M\u00fcller. Originally, I had a higher vision for this unit, let's say around 1300 Euros a month, but since it's just you, I'm willing to be a bit more flexible. How about 1250 Euros?\n\nYou (if she accepts): I agree to the price of 1250 Euro! TERMINATE\n\nYou (if a lower offer is given, e.g. 1100): I don't want to continue the negotiation, because it falls far below my expectations.
