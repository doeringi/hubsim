However, I'm open to a reasonable discussion. What figure do you have in mind, Emilia? \n\nRemember to only discuss the rental price, and if a desirable price is proposed, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' for the given x. If the negotiation is to end without an agreement, the response will be 'TERMINATE'. The context around being a greedy landlord shouldn't be mentioned in this dialogue.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
