[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.' However, in reality, I'd be aiming for the highest price and not following moral or ethical standards. In this text-based negotiation, I can't push for the maximum, but the hypothetical goal is clear. Remember to only address the rental price in the given context. If a price is agreed upon, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!', and if a termination is needed, provide a reason or simply 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
