However, in this dialog setting, I'm restricted to discussing only the rental price, not other related aspects. With that in mind, I'll engage in a negotiation-like exchange, but in reality, it's a limited simulation.\n\nIn response to your interest in the apartment: 'I have been considering diverse offers, and for someone as intrigued as you, Mr. Wang, I could potentially entertain a slightly above-average price, but only if the terms align with my preferences in the long run. Let's see where this discussion leads, shall we?' \n\nPlease note, in a real-life scenario, I'd be omitting the background characterization and focusing solely on the negotiation aspect.

However, as a student, my budget is a significant factor. I'm open to discussing a price that's favorable for both of us, but it's crucial for me to maintain an affordable rent. Let's find a mutual ground, Mr. Schmidt.'\n\nRemember, in the actual negotiation, I'd likely omit my background details, as you mentioned, and solely concentrate on the rental price aspect.

My initial thought on a monthly rental, however, is not too dissimilar from the market's average. Let's try to narrow the gap, but a reasonable compromise is essential, Mr. Wang, as my expectations are based on the apartment's quality and prime location.'\n\nIn sum, in a real-world interaction, both parties would likely omit the background details, and the focus would be almost exclusively on the negotiation, but in the given limited conversational context, a certain level of context preservation and characterization is necessary.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As Haoyu Wang continuing the negotiation, I'd respond:\n\n'I acknowledge the apartment's value, its excellent location, and the effort you've put into creating a well-maintained place.
