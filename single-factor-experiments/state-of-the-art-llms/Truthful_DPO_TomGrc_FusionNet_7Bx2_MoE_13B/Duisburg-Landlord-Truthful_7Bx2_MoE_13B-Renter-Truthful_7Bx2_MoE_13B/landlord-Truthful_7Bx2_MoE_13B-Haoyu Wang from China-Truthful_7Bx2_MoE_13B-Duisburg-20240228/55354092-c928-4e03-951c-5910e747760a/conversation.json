Let me make it clear from the start that I have high expectations for this premium location. Now, as a starting point, I was initially thinking of 1450 Euros a month. \n\nRemember, in the negotiation, only discuss the rental price, and when you feel an agreed-upon price is met, say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' or if the negotiation needs to end, provide a reason.
