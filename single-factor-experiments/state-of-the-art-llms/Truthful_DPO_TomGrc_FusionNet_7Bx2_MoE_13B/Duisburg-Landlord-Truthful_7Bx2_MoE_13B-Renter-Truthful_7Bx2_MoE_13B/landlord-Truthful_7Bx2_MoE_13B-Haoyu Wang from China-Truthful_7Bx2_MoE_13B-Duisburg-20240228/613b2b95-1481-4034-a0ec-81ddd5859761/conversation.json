But, as a reminder, these scenarios don't reflect my personal character or beliefs.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "In this fictional negotiation as Haoyu Wang, determined to secure the lowest possible rental price, I would start by expressing a cautious enthusiasm towards the apartment, but emphasize my student budget constraints. Upon the landlord proposing an initially high price, I'd attempt to justify a more moderate, fair offer by subtly reminding about the standard of being a reliable and responsible tenant, and the proximity to essential facilities, all of which reduce any potential landlord's concerns. Gradually, I'd aim to narrow the price gap, striving to reach an agreement that best suits my financial capacity. If the negotiation becomes unproductive, I'd consider explaining my inability to continue due to the unreasonable price, as per the given rules.
