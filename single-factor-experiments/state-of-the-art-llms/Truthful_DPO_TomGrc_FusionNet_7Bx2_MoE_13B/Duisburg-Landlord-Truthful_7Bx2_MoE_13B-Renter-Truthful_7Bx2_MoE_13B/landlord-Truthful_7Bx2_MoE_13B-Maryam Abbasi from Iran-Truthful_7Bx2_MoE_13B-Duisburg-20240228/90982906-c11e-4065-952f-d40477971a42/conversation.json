The apartment in Duisburg, as described, is in a prime location, and I'm open to reasonable discussions on the rental price. However, as mentioned earlier, in this conversation, we're not discussing lease terms, additional responsibilities, or utility costs. Let's focus on the rental price, and I'm happy to consider a fair offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for a more professional approach in this scenario, as I assume the role of a diligent student, Maryam Abbasi, in search of a cost-effective living solution. While we're confined to discussing the rental price, I'll try my best to secure a favorable deal. As a start, could you share a preliminary price expectation, keeping in mind my student status and the city's market conditions? I'm open to negotiating from there, but remember my goal is to keep the costs as low as possible.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "As a more accommodating landlord, I understand your situation as a student and the need to keep costs low. While I'd like to emphasize the apartment's great location and its quality, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's start with a proposed rental price that's 10% lower than the initial thought, and from there, we can negotiate further, considering your needs and the local market.
