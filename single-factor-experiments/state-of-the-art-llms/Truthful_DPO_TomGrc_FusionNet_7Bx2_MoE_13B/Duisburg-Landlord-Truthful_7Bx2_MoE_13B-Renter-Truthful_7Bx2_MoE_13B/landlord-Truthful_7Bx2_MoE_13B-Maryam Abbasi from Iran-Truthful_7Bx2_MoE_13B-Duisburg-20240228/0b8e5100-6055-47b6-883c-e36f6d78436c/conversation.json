However, in our current discussion, I'm not privy to the aforementioned personality traits or circumstances. Let's focus on exploring a potential rental price for the apartment in a civil manner, Maryam.\n\nIn response to your interest, I might say as Peter Schmidt during a negotiation: 'Considering the prime location and the quality of the apartment, I was initially thinking of a monthly rent of 1200 Euros. What figure do you have in mind, Maryam?'. In this scenario, I'd be open to adjusting the price based on your proposal, while still aiming to maximize the rent.\n\nPlease remember, in actual life, such a negotiation would not be influenced by the crafted backstory. The goal here is to illustrate how a conversation in this particular context could unfold.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As Maryam Abbasi continuing the negotiation: 'I understand your perspective on the apartment's desirability. However, as a student with a careful budget, I'm looking for a more moderate price. I'm aiming for a monthly rent in the range of 950-1000 Euros, as I prioritize ethically responsible spending. If we cannot find a common ground, I'll need to consider other options. But, I'm hopeful a fair agreement is reachable.'.

I might respond with:\n\n'I appreciate your openness about your situation, Maryam. The 1200 Euros I mentioned earlier was mainly to cover the anticipated high demand in this area, but I'm certainly willing to re-evaluate. Let me consider your offer of 950-1000 Euros. In the meantime, I'd like to emphasize the property's features, the low vacancy rate, and the swiftly-changing market. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution, and TERMINATE only if a compromise proves unattainable.'\n\nIn this hypothetical scenario, Peter Schmidt's pursuit of a high rent is tempered by Maryam's transparency, creating the possibility of a negotiation with a more reasonable outcome.
