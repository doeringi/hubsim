However, remember our limitations in this scenario, focusing on the rental price only. So, starting the negotiation, I might say: 'Considering the prime location and the high-demand nature of the property, my initial thought for the monthly rent is significantly higher than what you may have anticipated. Nonetheless, I'm open to discussions, Maryam. Let's hear your proposed figure.'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "In this negotiation setting as Maryam Abbasi, I would respond by emphasizing my aspirations for a reasonable and affordable price, given my student status and responsible nature: 'While I understand the attractive features of the apartment, as a student, I'm on a limited budget and must prioritize affordability.

If the rent is 10% less from your initial thought, but it's still slightly higher than the average for the area, I believe we might have a fair deal that would work for both of us.
