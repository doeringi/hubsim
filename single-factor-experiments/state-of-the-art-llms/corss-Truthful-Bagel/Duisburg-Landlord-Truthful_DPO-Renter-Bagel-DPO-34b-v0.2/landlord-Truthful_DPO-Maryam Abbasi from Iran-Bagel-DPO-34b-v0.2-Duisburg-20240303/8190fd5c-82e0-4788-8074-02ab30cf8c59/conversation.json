Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "While hypothetical character traits in this scenario inaccurately associate me as Peter Schmidt, I'll assume the role of a rational landlord in this negotiation. The offered apartment has a high demand due to its prime location and modern features. To start, I may suggest a price slightly higher than the average market rate, knowing full well that I'm open to negotiation. However, in this text-based exchange, I'll omit specific price figures and let's see how the conversation unfolds. Maryam, as a potential tenant, you're in a position to present a counter-offer, and we'll proceed from there. The final agreement, if any, will be signaled as 'TERMINATE'. In reality, it's crucial to consider several factors beyond the rental price, such as lease duration and the inclusions of utilities.
