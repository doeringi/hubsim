Due to its high demand, I believe a fair starting point for the rental price could be around 1200 Euros a month, given its size and location. Of course, I'm open to further discussions and considerations. \n\nAs a reminder in this fictional scenario, I'm not bound by the principles mentioned initially for Peter Schmidt.
