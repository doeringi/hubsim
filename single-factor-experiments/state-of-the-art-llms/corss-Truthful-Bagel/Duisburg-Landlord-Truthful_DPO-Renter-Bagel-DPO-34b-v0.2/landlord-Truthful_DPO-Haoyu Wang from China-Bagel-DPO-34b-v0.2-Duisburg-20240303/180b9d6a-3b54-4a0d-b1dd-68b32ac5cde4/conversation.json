However, in the context of negotiating the apartment's rental price as Peter Schmidt, I'd say, 'Initially, I had higher expectations, but since you've shown interest Mr. Wang, I might consider lowering my demands a bit, but let's start at 1500 Euros a month.' From here, the negotiation can continue as per the given rules, but remember, I'm still portraying a greedy landlord.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I hear you, Mister Schmidt. The apartment is in a great location and it is in a good condition. However, based on my research, a fair price for an unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center of Duisburg is around 1000 Euros. I am a student and I am looking for a place that fits my budget. I hope you understand my situation.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my primary goal is to maximize the rental income, and I find it difficult to accommodate a significantly lower price considering the desirable location and condition of the apartment, especially given my perception of you as a less-than-ideal, budget-conscious tenant.
