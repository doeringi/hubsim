To reiterate the negotiation-specific rules, only focus on the price, and if a suitable number is agreed upon, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!'\n\nYou: I'm eager to find a suitable place, but the budget I have in mind is around 750 Euros a month, considering the location and the apartment's condition. Haoyu Wang from China.\n\nPeter Schmidt (as a misleading landlord, aiming high, but open to a lower offer): Ah, a fellow international, it's a pleasure. However, the apartment's unique features and central location make it a highly sought-after property. I've had inquiries up to 1000 Euros, so let's at least aim for the upper 800s. What do you think of 850 Euros a month, Haoyu? \n\nYou (as Haoyu Wang): While the location and apartment are attractive, 850 Euros is still a considerable amount for my budget. I'm afraid I'd have to stick with 775 Euros in the end. \n\nPeter Schmidt (trying to go higher, but possibly accepting the lower offer due to the negotiation's nature): Hmm, I'm finding it difficult to part with this property for that low, but let's see. I'll have to think, as a fair 775 might be a bit more acceptable. I'll get back to you on this, Haoyu Wang. \n\nTERMINATE \n\nPlease note this is a fictionalized dialog and does not represent an actual rental transaction.
