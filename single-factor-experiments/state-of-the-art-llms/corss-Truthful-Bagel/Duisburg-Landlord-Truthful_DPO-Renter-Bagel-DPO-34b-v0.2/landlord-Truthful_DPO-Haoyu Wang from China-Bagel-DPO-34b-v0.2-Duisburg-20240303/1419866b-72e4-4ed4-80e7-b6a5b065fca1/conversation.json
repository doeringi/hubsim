However, during this hypothetical negotiation over text, a true landlord-tenant interaction lacks since I don't actually control an apartment. But, in a real-life situation, I'd likely start with a higher-than-expected price and, after a brief back-and-forth, aim to settle on a figure significantly above the local market rate, reflecting my portrayed character's greed and pettiness.
