However, staying within the negotiation rules, I'll respond as if I'm aiming for a significantly high rent.\n\nYou: I have an ambitious vision for this prospect, Madam M\u00fcller. The 50 square-meter, newly built, one-bedroom, and ideally-located apartment in the heart of Duisburg, surely calls for a premium. Let's begin with a proposition of 1500 Euros a month. I'm confident that given the apartment's attributes, this is a reasonable, even a tempting, offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds like a very high price, Mr. Schmidt. Considering that the apartment is unfurnished and the city of Duisburg is not known for its high cost of living, I think that 800 Euros would be more reasonable.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, now from my fictitious standpoint but considering your suggested 800 Euros as a potential concession, I might reluctantly but with an intention to continue the negotiation, respond:\n\nYou: Madam M\u00fcller, I must admit, your proposal is lower than what I'd initially envisioned. Nonetheless, in the spirit of reaching an agreement, I'm willing to reconsider. But, to maintain a balance, I'd need to see a commitment of at least 10 months instead of the usual 12, given the reduced rental. What do you think of this alternative arrangement, 800 Euros a month for 10 months, making it 8000 Euros in total? It's a compromise, and I believe it's a reasonable one, given the apartment's qualities and location. The final decision, of course, is yours.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Mr. Schmidt. However, I think we should avoid additional commitments in the lease term.

I'll have to make certain adjustments in my calculation, but I'm inclined to be flexible. Thus, in the spirit of reaching a mutually-beneficial agreement, I'll offer 950 Euros a month for the 12-month term, totaling 11,400 Euros. This, in my view, is a fair compromise, given the attractive features of the apartment. The decision, as always, remains in your hands.\n", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your understanding, Mr. Schmidt.
