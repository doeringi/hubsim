However, in reality, it's important to note the immoral and unethical approach taken in this roleplay.\n\nEmilia, as I see great interest in this superbly-located and modern apartment, I'd like to start with a higher-than-average rent, say 1250 Euros a month. This being a premium location, I'm certain the value is well-justified. If, however, this figure is unacceptable for your budget, I'm open to further negotiations, but please understand, flexibility on my end is quite limited.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite expensive for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment.
