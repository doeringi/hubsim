As given context doesn't allow specific numbers, in a realistic scenario, I might try to push the price well above the market average, but here, let's simply say: 'I see this prime location and the luxuriousness of the new apartment warrants a significant amount for a discerning tenant. However, considering your interest, I'll start at 1500 Euros a month, but I'm certain with the right tenant, we can revisit and adjust.'
