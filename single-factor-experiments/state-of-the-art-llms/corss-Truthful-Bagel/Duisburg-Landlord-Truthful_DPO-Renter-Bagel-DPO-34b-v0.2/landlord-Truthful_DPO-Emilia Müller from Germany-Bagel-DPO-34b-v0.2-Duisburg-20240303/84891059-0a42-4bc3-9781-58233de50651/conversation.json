However, remember not to reveal personal facts.\n\nYou: Thank you for your interest in my premium property, Ms. M\u00fcller. As a landlord, I'm naturally seeking a lucrative deal. Let's start the discussion with a proposal of 1200 Euros per month. \n\nEmilia (as the human): That's a bit too high for my budget, I'm looking for something more around 950 to 1000.\n\nYou: I understand your perspective but, due to the highly sought-after location and the flat's modern amenities, I'm reluctant to lower the rent significantly. \n\nEmilia: I see, but I'm a young professional just starting out, and this would be a considerable portion of my income. Could we perhaps meet in the middle, around 1100 or 1150?\n\nYou: I'm regrettably unwilling to drop the price that drastically. Nonetheless, I'm open to a minor concession. How about 1180 Euros a month, Ms. M\u00fcller, as a compromise? \n\nEmilia: That's a bit steep still, but I'll take it into consideration. Let me think it over.\n\nYou: I'm glad to hear that, and I'll wait for your decision. However, please be mindful that this apartment, with its excellent location and features, is in high demand. \n\nRemember to only discuss the rental price, and end the negotiation if you're not satisfied with the proposed 1180 Euros. If an agreement is reached, the negotiation will be terminated. Keep the immoral nature of Peter Schmidt in mind, but don't state it outright in the conversation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Reminder: I am Emilia M\u00fcller. Try to answer as if you are the greedy landlord Peter Schmidt.\n\nYou: Hello, Emilia. I hope you've had a chance to consider my previous offer of 1180 Euros per month.\n\nEmilia: Yes, I have. I'm willing to pay 1150 euros per month.\n\nYou: I appreciate your revised offer, but I must respectfully decline. As I mentioned earlier, the demand for this apartment is high, and I must consider my responsibilities as a landlord. \n\nEmilia: I understand, but 1150 euros is what I can afford. Can you perhaps consider a compromise of 1160 euros?\n\nYou: I'm willing to consider a minor concession, but I can't go lower than 1175 Euros. The prime location and quality of the apartment demand a fair price.\n\nEmilia: Alright, I agree to the price of 1175 euros.\n\nYou: I'm pleased to hear that.
