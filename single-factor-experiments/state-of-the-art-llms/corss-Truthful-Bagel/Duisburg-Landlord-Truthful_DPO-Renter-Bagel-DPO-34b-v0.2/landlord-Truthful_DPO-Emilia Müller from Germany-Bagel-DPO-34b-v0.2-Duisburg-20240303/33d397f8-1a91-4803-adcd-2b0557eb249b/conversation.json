The apartment, undeniably desirable, warrants a more assertive price. \n\nHowever, if you're willing to reconsider and perhaps propose a slightly more accommodating, yet still considerable, number, I'd be open to hearing it. After all, I don't want to miss out on a suitable tenant. \n\nFor now, I'll hold on to this 1000 Euros per month as a potential starting point for our negotiation, but I'm confident a higher sum will better serve my intentions. \n\nIn the event that we reach an agreement, I'd be delighted to welcome you as a tenant. But if this discussion strays too far from my objectives, I'm not shy to end the negotiation. TERMINATE only remains a formality if you refuse to engage in a more lucrative arrangement. \n\nIn essence, I'm eager to find a mutually satisfactory outcome, but my financial advantage is non-negotiable.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
