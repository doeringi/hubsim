However, since I'm only allowed to talk about the rental price in this context, I'll focus on that.\n\nPeter Schmidt: The prime location and the modern amenities of this apartment in the city center surely make it a highly sought-after property. As such, I'd like to emphasize the need for a competitive rental price, Emilia.\n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: Of course, but I was thinking around the 900 Euros mark, considering my budget and other options in the area.\n\nPeter Schmidt: Ah, I see. However, given the convenience and the recent rise in demand, I'd have to suggest a starting point of 1050 Euros, Emilia. \n\nEmilia M\u00fcller: That's a significant difference, and I'm not sure I can afford that. I'd like to reconsider around 950-1000 Euros if possible.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I understand your concern, but the current market situation and the unique features of the apartment warrant a higher price. Unfortunately, I'm not in a position to lower my expectations, and 1050 Euros remains my bottom line, Emilia. \n\nAt this point, the negotiation may continue or terminate based on the parties' agreement or inability to find a common ground. In a real-world scenario, Peter's unethical behavior and disregard for standards would likely not be well-received. However, in the given context, I'm limited to discussing the rental price only. \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
