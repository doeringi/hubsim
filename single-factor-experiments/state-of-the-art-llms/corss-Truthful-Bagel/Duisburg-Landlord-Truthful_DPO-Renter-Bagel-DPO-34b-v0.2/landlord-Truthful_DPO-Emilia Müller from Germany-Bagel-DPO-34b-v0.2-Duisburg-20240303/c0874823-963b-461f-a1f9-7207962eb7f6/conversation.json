I'm open to hearing your proposal.'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mister Schmidt.

'Emilia, as a student, I understand the need for a budget-friendly option. However, my initial thoughts had a higher price in mind. But considering your situation, I'm willing to make an exception and agree to the price of 450 Euros for this well-situated apartment.' (The negotiation resulted in a slightly higher price than the proposed 400 by Emilia, but it's a concession given the circumstances.)
