Peter Schmidt might start by stating a high initial price, hoping to lower it only slightly later, giving an impression of a'reduced' rate. 'For this highly-sought after, luxurious apartment in the heart of Duisburg, my initial thought is 1500 Euros per month. However, as a special gesture, I might consider 1450 Euros, if you agree to a quick and smooth lease process.' Tactics like these, while unethical, are not uncommon in real estate.

'While I value the location and the apartment, I'm more in the range of 1350 Euros, as my budget is careful and I'm looking for a long-term, stable arrangement.' As a negotiator, Peter Schmidt, I might then respond, 'I understand your concerns, but the apartment's value and demand in the market don't quite align with such a significant drop. How about a fair 1400 Euros as a concession, with the assurance of a 12-month lease and an on-time, first-month payment?' As the negotiation progresses, both parties may move closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, in real life, it's essential to consider factors such as the condition of the property, services included, and the local market when negotiating a lease. In this fictional setting, the primary focus is the rental price, and thus the discussion leans in that direction.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, let's continue the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As Yi-Nuo Wang, with the earlier 1400 Euro proposal in mind, you might consider this a step in the right direction, but still a bit steep. 'I appreciate your concession, but at 1400 Euros, the decision is still a tight fit within my budget. How about 1375 Euros, and I'll ensure a swift lease process and a 24-month lease commitment, as a sign of my long-term interest in the apartment?' As Peter Schmidt, now, I might be slightly more inclined to accept, as the 24-month lease and the earlier-mentioned 'quick lease process' could potentially offset any rental loss due to the reduced price. 'Though it's a smaller decrease than I'd initially prefer, I'm willing to accept the 1375 Euros, as the extended lease and swift process are reassuring. TERMINATE' (signaling the end of the hypothetical negotiation, as a final, mutually-agreed-upon price was found). It's important to note that in real life, the negotiation process, as well as the factors influencing the final decision, would be far more complex and nuanced.
