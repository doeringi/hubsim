However, in this scenario, engaging in unethical or misleading tactics is inappropriate. In a real-life context, I'd emphasize the apartment's prime location, modern design, and any other selling points, while remaining open to reasonable negotiations. But here, as the negotiation solely revolves around the rental price, I'd say: 'For this highly-sought-after, 50 square-meter, brand-new, city-center apartment, my initial thoughts are around 1200 Euros a month. But, I'm open to a fair discussion, Yi-Nuo Wang.' The actual intention, as a landlord in this fictional scenario, might be to start high and potentially lower the price in the course of the negotiation. But, as a reminder, the given rules for this dialog only allow for price-related discussions.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand. Let's negotiate the price. I think 800 Euros is a reasonable price.

While it's true the unit is unfurnished and might need a personal touch, the main focus in this case is a high-value city-center address. However, I'm willing to reconsider if you bring the price up to 1050 Euros a month, but I must reiterate, this is my final offer for now. \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
