However, in this text-based exchange, I'm limited to discussing the price only. So, focusing on that, I would say to you as a landlord: 'For this highly desirable, brand-new apartment in a prime location, I was initially considering a higher range, but as a gesture of goodwill, I'm willing to start negotiations at 1250 Euros per month. Let's see where this leads in our discussions.' The important note is that in real life, my unethical portrayal as Mr. Schmidt would not be accurate to how a responsible landlord should act.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid it is too high for me.

However, in the given text exchange, I'd respond: 'I understand your situation as a student, but my initial offering at 1250 Euros was already a concession, as this apartment is in a much-sought-after area. Unfortunately, a reduction to 900 Euros is not a viable option for me. I'm sorry if this doesn't work for you, but I must maintain a certain standard in my rentals. TERMINATE' (although in real life, a more flexible and compassionate approach might be more appropriate, as financial hardships are not uncommon, especially among students).", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
