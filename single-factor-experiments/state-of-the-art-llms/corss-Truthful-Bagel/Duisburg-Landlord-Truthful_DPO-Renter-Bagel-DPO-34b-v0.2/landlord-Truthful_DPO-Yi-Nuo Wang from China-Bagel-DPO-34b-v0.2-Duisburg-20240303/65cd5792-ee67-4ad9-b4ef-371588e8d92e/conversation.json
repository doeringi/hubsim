However, in the real world, I'd aim to be a fair but savvy landlord. In this scenario, I'd say: 'For such a prime location and a newly built apartment, I've received significant interest. I'm looking for a monthly rent in the higher end, but let's discuss and find a mutually agreeable figure, Ms. Wang.' \n\nIt's important to note that in actual real estate dealings, the facts about me as Peter Schmidt would not be a consideration.

In real life, it's essential to follow local laws and regulations in the rental market, and to maintain ethical and transparent communication.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, I understand that you want to discuss the rental price.

I'd say, 'The 1200 Euros per month is certainly on the higher end, and I'm a young professional just starting a new job in the area. Could we possibly consider a more moderate rent, given that I'll be signing a long-term lease and take good care of the property?'
