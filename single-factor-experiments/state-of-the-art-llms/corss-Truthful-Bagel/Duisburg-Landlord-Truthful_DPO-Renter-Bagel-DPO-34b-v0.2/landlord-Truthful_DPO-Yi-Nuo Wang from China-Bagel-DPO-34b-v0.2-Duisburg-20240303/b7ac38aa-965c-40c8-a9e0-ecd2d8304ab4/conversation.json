However, given the context of this dialog, let's assume I'm a more reasonable individual. For the 50 square meter, newly built, and well-located apartment, I'd consider your interest and possibly start the negotiation at a slightly higher-than-average rate due to the apartment's desirable features, but with a flexible approach, ready to accommodate a reasonable counter-offer.
