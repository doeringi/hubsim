However, as the negotiation solely revolves around the rental price here, let me begin with a somewhat exorbitant offer. 'I agree to the price of 1500 Euro!' But in reality, I'd act quite differently as a landlord. Note, the given scenario constrains the discussion.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, but I must politely decline. I am willing to pay a more reasonable price for the apartment.\nAs you may know, Duisburg, although centrally located, is not among the most expensive cities in Germany. Therefore, I believe a lower price can be negotiated.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hypothetically responding as Peter Schmidt, yet reluctantly: 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, but only if I can't lower my expectations less than by 300 Euros. The new offer would be 1200 Euro!' Again, in reality, I'd likely not be this flexible, but the scenario's constraints drive the interaction.
