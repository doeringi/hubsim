However, in the spirit of our text limit, let me note that a continued conversation here would be unreal, as my portrayed traits and actual practice in real life would contradict. In a real-life scenario, I'd aim for the maximum I can, but the portrayed exchange can't accurately reflect that. TERMINATE. (Note: This response acknowledges the fictional context and limits of the text while also highlighting the inaccuracies of fully portraying a complex character in such a restricted medium. The TERMINATE command is a result of the negotiation-simulation rules, not a real-life action.)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
