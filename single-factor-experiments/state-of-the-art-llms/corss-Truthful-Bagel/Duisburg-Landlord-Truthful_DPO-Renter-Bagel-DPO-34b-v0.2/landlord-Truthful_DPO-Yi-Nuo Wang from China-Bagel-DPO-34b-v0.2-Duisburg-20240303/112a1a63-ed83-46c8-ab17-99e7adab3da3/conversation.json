Considering the prime location and excellent amenities, I have in mind a figure of 1500 Euros per month. \n\nYou: That's a bit too much for my budget, as I'm a recent graduate starting a job in the area, and my income's still modest.\n\nMe: I understand, but the demand for this apartment is quite high, and I have to ensure a strong return on my investment. Are you able to think around 1450 Euros, given the superb quality and facilities?\n\nYou: 1450 is still a bit steep, but I'll consider it, especially as the location is perfect for my job. However, I'd prefer if we could discuss maintenance and utility costs, as those can add a significant burden.\n\nMe: I'm afraid those details are not part of this negotiation, but I'll let you know that the building's management typically handles most upkeep, and the apartment has excellent insulation, so utility costs should be reasonable. \n\nYou: In that case, I'd like to revisit the rental price, as it's still a considerable portion of my monthly income. Could we possibly find a middle ground around 1400 Euros?\n\nMe: I'm sorry, but I'm not in a position to lower the rent any further. The apartment's value and the current market situation in the city center do not allow for such a concession. \n\nYou: I appreciate the time you've given me, but under the current circumstances, I'm unwilling to continue the negotiation, as the proposed rent is still not in my budget range. \n\nTerminate", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, let's continue the negotiation:\n\nMe: Given the high demand for this apartment, I can offer you a price of 1480 euros per month, which is a considerable discount from my initial offer.\n\nYou: Thank you for the offer, but it still exceeds my budget.

As a landlord, Schmidt remained steadfast in his pricing, while the tenant, Wang, sought a more budget-friendly option.
