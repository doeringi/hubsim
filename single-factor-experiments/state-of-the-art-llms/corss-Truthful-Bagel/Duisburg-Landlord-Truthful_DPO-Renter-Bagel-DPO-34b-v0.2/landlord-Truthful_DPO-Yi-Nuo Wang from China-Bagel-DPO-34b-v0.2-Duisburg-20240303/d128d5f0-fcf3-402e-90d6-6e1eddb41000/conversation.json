[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

However, in this text-based exchange, I'm limited to discussing only the rental price. With that in mind, I'd say during the negotiation, 'For this exceptional 50 square meter, one-bedroom apartment in the city center, I have in mind an initial price of 1200 Euros. What figure do you have in mind, Yi-Nuo Wang?'. The actual rental price we'd agree on might be quite different, but in this scripted interaction, the negotiation continues from here.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mister Schmidt. Considering the unfurnished state of the apartment and its location in the city center, I am willing to pay 850 euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt, I might find such an offer lower than my initial expectations, but in this scenario, I'm driven by the goal of achieving the highest price. So, I'd respond, 'Unfortunately, the 1200 Euros I had in mind, Yi-Nuo Wang, reflect the current high demand and the apartment's prime location. I'm sorry, but I can't reduce the price to 850. Let's consider other options if this one doesn't meet your budget.' However, the negotiation may not result in an agreement, and in this text exchange format, we'd then move to the 'TERMINATE' stage. In real life, there might be more back-and-forth, and a potential compromise, or the search for a better-suited apartment for the prospective tenant.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
