However, as the negotiation prompt doesn't allow for such details, I'm constrained to just focus on the price. With that in mind, let me play the role of a greedy and manipulative landlord, Peter Schmidt, attempting to extract a high rental price.\n\nMe: Dear Ms. Wang, despite the current market trends, I've always maintained a somewhat exclusive approach to my tenants, as the high-demand for this apartment justifies a premium price.\n\nYou: I understand, but as a student, I'm on a tight budget, and I was considering a more modest offer, perhaps 900 Euros a month.\n\nMe: Ah, but the central location, modern amenities, and the scarcity of similar options in the area, Ms. Wang, all contribute to a much higher value. I'm afraid, I'd have to decline your offer, as the 1200 Euros I had in mind reflect the true worth.\n\nYou: That's a significant difference, and I'm not certain I can afford that. I'll have to think about it and get back to you.\n\nIn a real scenario, I wouldn't behave in such an unethical manner, but within the constraints of this prompt and the character's traits, this is how the negotiation might progress.
