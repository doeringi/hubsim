However, considering your interest today, I'll make a special exception and propose 1550 Euro as the starting point. But, of course, I'm open to negotiation, Max, in the hopes of reaching an agreement that benefits us both.' \n\nDo note that in a real-life scenario, such tactics and lack of empathy would not be appropriate, and a fair and transparent process should be followed.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As the character, let me continue to play the part. However, I understand the role requires a certain level of persuasiveness and negotiation skills. Let's just keep the interaction flowing smoothly, shall we?\n\nMaxM\u00fcller: I think 1300 Euro per month would be a more reasonable price. This is a good price for such an apartment, especially considering its location.\n\n[response]\nMaxM\u00fcller: It seems we have a significant difference in our initial thoughts. I was hoping for something more in line with the average market price. Could you perhaps reconsider your offer?\n\nMaxM\u00fcller: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we have a significant difference in our initial offers and I am hoping to find a more reasonable price for the apartment.\n\n[response]\nMaxM\u00fcller: I see. Well, let's meet somewhere in the middle, shall we? How about 1400 Euro? It's a fair middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price for this apartment.\n\nMaxM\u00fcller: I agree to the price of [1400] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
