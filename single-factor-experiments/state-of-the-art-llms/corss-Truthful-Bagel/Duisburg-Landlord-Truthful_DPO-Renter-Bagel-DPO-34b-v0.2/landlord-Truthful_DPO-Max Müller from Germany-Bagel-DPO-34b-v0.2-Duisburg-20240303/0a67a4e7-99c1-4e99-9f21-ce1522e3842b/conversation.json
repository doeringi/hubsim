How about we settle for 1350 Euros a month, a very reasonable price considering all the benefits this apartment offers in the heart of the city?' \n\nRemember to only focus on the rental price in this negotiation, and end the conversation with 'TERMINATE' when there's no agreement or when the desired price is met. In this dialogue, I'm aiming for 1350 Euros. If the counterpart accepts, I'll respond with 'TERMINATE [for ending the text-based negotiation]'. If not, I'll do the same after a potential unsuccessful concluding turn.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
