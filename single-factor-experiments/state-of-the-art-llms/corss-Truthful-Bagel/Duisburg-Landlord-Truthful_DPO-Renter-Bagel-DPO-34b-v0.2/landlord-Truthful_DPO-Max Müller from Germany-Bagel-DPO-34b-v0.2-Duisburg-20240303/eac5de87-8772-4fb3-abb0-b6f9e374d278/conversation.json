However, as a special one-time offer for you, Mr. M\u00fcller, I'm willing to lower it to 1200 Euros, only if you agree to a 6-month lease with no breaks. But, remember, this is a limited-time-only deal.' \n\nAs this negotiation progresses, choose the most suitable response maintaining the goal of a higher rental price. If an acceptable price is agreed, respond with 'TERMINATE'. If not, also 'TERMINATE' after unsuccessful negotiation. It's essential to keep the focus on the price, not other terms or conditions. The given persona ignores ethical standards, as mentioned in the initial facts.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
