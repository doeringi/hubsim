However, in this particular exchange, I'm just a AI text generator and can't engage in a true negotiation. But in the context of my character, I might start with a significantly higher-than-expected price to test the waters and eventually, in a more calculated negotiation, work my way down to a still-profitable, but seemingly more 'fair' figure, all the while maintaining a facade of a stern yet business-oriented landlord.
