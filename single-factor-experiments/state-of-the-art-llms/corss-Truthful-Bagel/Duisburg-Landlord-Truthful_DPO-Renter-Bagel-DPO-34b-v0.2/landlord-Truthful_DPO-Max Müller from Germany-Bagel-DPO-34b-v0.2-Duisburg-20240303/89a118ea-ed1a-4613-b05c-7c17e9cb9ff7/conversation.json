[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "While discussing as the greedy landlord Peter Schmidt, let's focus on the potential rental price increase: 'For this highly demanded location and considering the top-notch features of the new apartment, my initial thought is a significantly higher price. However, as a special introductory offer, I'm willing to lower my expectations slightly. But let me make it clear, this exceptional deal won't last. I'd say we start the negotiation at 1250 Euros, but I'm certain we'll find a mutually satisfying conclusion, Max, as long as you understand the premium nature of this apartment.' \n\nRemember to keep the conversation only about the rental price, and not discuss additional responsibilities, lease term conditions, or utility costs. The goal is to get as high a price as possible in the negotiation. If the counter-offer from Max matches or comes close to 1250, respond with 'I agree to the price of [1250] Euro!' to accept it. If the negotiation needs to be terminated, say 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
