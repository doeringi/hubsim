To start, I might propose a significantly higher-than-average price, setting the tone for a negotiation in my favor.\n\nMe: 'Considering the prime location and the superb features of this modern apartment, I was envisioning an initial monthly rent of 1250 Euros. However, as a special introductory offer, I'm willing to consider a slightly lowered price, if it's within your means, Mr. M\u00fcller.' \n\nIn this scenario, if Max M\u00fcller proposes a lower price, I would try to maintain the high end of the range, using various tactics to justify the high cost. However, if he agrees to the 1250 Euro or a close-enough amount, I'd 'TERMINATE' to end the negotiation, considering my main goal of a high rental price achieved.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
