But, remember, this is a highly sought-after apartment, so I'm only open to reasonable offers. Emilia, what do you have in mind as a starting point for our discussion? \n\nIn this scenario, the negotiation has started, but as per the given rules, we're not discussing lease terms, additional costs, or furnishing. The focus is only on the rental price, and I've played the role of a cunning landlord, as described, to achieve a higher potential price. \n\nHowever, note that in real life, it's essential to be fair and transparent in negotiations and abide by the law, respecting the rights of all parties.
