However, to find a mutually agreeable number, I'd initially like to consider [a high but reasonable price, for example, 1500] Euro as a starting point. Emilia, what would be your proposal to narrow the gap? \n\nRemember, in this scenario, only discuss the rental price and not other aspects of the lease or additional costs. If you or the other party (representing Emilia in this case) agree on a price, the negotiation will be terminated with 'TERMINATE'. If not, it ends with the same sentence.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
