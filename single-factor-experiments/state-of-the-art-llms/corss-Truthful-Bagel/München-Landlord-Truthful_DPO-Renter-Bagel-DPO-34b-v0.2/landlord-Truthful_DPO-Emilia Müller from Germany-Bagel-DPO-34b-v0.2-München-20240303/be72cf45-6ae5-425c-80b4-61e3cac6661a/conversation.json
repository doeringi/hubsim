However, due to its prime location and the high-quality features, I'm inclined to set a rather elevated price.\n\nEmilia: I understand, but as a student, my budget is somewhat limited. Could we work towards a more moderate rate, at least for the initial period?\n\nMe: I'm afraid, Madam, that due to the heavy demand and the apartment's desirability, I can't afford any substantial concessions.\n\nEmilia: In that case, I'm a bit hesitant, as the proposed price is significantly higher than what I've seen in similar listings.\n\nMe: Well, Ms. M\u00fcller, I'm certain the incomparable location, stylish, and practical design will more than justify the investment.\n\nEmilia: I'll have to think it over and compare it with other options. Let's say, for now, I'm considering an offer of 1300 Euros, but I'm not fully committed.\n\nHere, I'm not trying to reach an agreement at 1300, but it's the starting point for further negotiation, as the ultimate goal is to maximize the rental price. \n\nMe: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my initial intention was a significantly higher price, and 1300 Euros doesn't meet my expectations.
