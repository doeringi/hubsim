[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

However, as a real-life interaction, I'd like to emphasize that a landlord should always follow local laws and ethical practices, and this fictional portrayal doesn't reflect that. But in a negotiation, I might say something like: 'Considering the prime location and the quality of the new construction, I was thinking of a monthly rent around 1500 Euros. What do you find reasonable, Mr. Abbasi?'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, let's stick to the script. So, as Farhad Abbasi, I want to negotiate for the lowest possible price. So, you are asking for 1500 Euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "As Peter Schmidt following the scenario rules, I would confirm the proposed price: 'Yes, I'm proposing a monthly rent of 1500 Euros, given the attractive features the apartment has to offer.'\n\nNow, as Farhad Abbasi trying to negotiate the lowest possible price, you could respond: 'I'm sorry but I find that price a bit steep, particularly for an unfurnished apartment.
