However, in a hypothetical situation, as a landlord, I might aim for a high price, but the actual negotiation would be more complex, taking into account factors such as the local market, the tenant's background, and the state of the property, in addition to the moral and ethical considerations you mentioned, which I, as an AI, do not have. In real life, it's crucial to follow fair housing practices and local laws. I hope this provides some perspective.\n\nIn the original roleplay, a potential response could be: 'Perhaps I can start with considering an amount well above the standard market rate, but ultimately, the decision will depend on the proposal you put forth, Mr. Abbasi.'
