[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

As a prominent location in the city center, the rent here is quite competitive. Let's start the discussion at 1200 Euros a month. What's your initial thoughts on this figure?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a little bit higher than I expected. Would you be willing to lower the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "You: I understand your perspective but, due to the high demand and the premium location, it's a challenging market to lower the rent extensively. However, considering your interest, I'm willing to reconsider at 1150 Euros, a concession for a qualified tenant like yourself. Is that a more suitable option for you, Mr. Abbasi?\n\nYou now assess if you're satisfied with this new proposed price or if you wish to continue negotiating. If a mutually agreeable price is not found, the negotiation will be terminated. In this text exchange, the negotiation is still ongoing.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your generosity, but I think we can find a price that works for both of us.

I'm afraid, Mr. Abbasi, I'm not in a position to go any lower. If, in the future, your budget may increase, I'd be more than happy to reconsider your application.
