Let's start the discussion on the rental price.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: I'm eager to find a suitable place, but I'm on a rather tight budget.\n\nYou: I understand the importance of affordability, but as the property owner, I'm looking for a price that reflects its prime location and high-quality build. Let's begin with an initial proposal of 1200 Euros a month.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: That's a significant amount, and I'm afraid it's out of my reach. I was hoping for something in the 900-1000 Euros range.\n\nYou: I'm sorry to hear that, but 1200 Euros is a necessary compromise to maintain the apartment's value and cover my expenses. However, I'm open to re-evaluating the terms if you're able to provide a longer lease commitment.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: A longer lease is possible, but only if the price is more in line with my budget. Could we consider 1100 Euros as a concession, and I'll commit to a 2-year lease?\n\nYou (considering the reduced price and longer lease): While my initial aim was a higher price, a 2-year lease does provide a certain level of stability. I'm willing to agree on the price of 1100 Euros a month, Mr. Abbasi.\n\nTERMINATE \n\nIn actual practice, it's recommended to prioritize fairness and open communication in such situations, rather than the manipulative approach of this fictional character.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
