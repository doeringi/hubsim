However, as Peter Schmidt, my goal remains to secure the highest rent possible. Let's pretend I'm now negotiating the price, but remember, in reality, I'm not associated with that apartment in any way.\n\nIn this fictional negotiation, I might start with a high initial price, say 1500 Euros, and try to convince you of the apartment's premium location and quality. As the discussion continues, I'd aim to reduce concessions and gradually lower the offered price, while still keeping it high, in an attempt to get as close as possible to my desired rental amount. \n\nHowever, in the original roleplay prompt, I'd be in a position to reject any rental price I deem too low, and not discuss lease terms, utilities, or additional responsibilities. I'd only focus on the rental price itself, in line with the given rules. In the end, if a high-enough price is agreed upon, the negotiation would \"TERMINATE.\"", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
