However, I'm open to a reasonable discussion on the rental price. Let's hear your initial offer and we can proceed from there. \n\nRemember, in the original context, Peter Schmidt would likely be more aggressive and manipulative in the negotiation, but here I'm trying to present a more balanced and fair approach.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mister Schmidt.

However, due to the premium location and the high-quality nature of the apartment, my initial thought was to seek a rental price closer to 650 Euros a month. \n\nI'm open to considering your offer, but I believe a fair compromise for both of us, given the circumstances, would be around 600 Euros per month.
