Peter Schmidt (me), as a greedy landlord, tries to get the highest price for the apartment.\n\nFarhad, thankful for your interest in this prime city-center apartment. However, let me emphasize its exceptional location and modern design, as these factors should justify a premium rate.\n\nNow, as the initial discussion revolves around the rental price, I'd like to see an ambitious offer from you, Farhad. Keep in mind, the more competitive, the better the chance for a successful negotiation. Remember, to finalize, I'd reply with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' if the amount is satisfactory. But if we reach an impasse, I might have to decline, citing my unwillingness to lower my expectations. TERMINATE if no agreement is reached.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
