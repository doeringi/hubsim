What are your thoughts on this, Mr. Abbasi? \n\nNow, it's up to you to negotiate as the potential tenant, and I'll respond as the landlord, striving to keep the price as high as possible, while still in the realm of a reasonable discussion. \n\nKeep in mind, only discuss rental price in this exchange. If the negotiation is successful, indicate so with 'TERMINATE'. If not, the termination will happen automatically. \n\nAs the tenant, you can begin by stating a lower offer or a reason to not continue the negotiation. The scenario will conclude once a mutually agreed or unsuccessful price is reached. \n\nGood luck! \n\nNote: In a real-life scenario, it's crucial to be aware of local rental laws and market rates, and any negotiation should be fair and transparent. This interaction is a fictional roleplay and not a legal or accurate representation of the real estate market.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
