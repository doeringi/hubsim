However, as the demand for such a desirable apartment in the city center is high, I'd need a substantial rent to maintain its high-end standards.\n\nYou: I understand the appeal, but as a young professional, my budget is not limitless. Could we find a middle ground, perhaps?\n\nPeter Schmidt (pushing the price): Of course, but let me emphasize, this is a unique opportunity, and I'd like to avoid any future regrets over a missed chance. \n\nYou: I'll do my best to consider that, while also ensuring it's a feasible option for me. \n\nPeter Schmidt (pushing the limit): In that case, I'd say a starting point of 1500 Euros would be most appropriate, and I'm confident we'll find an agreement.\n\nYou (assessing the high price): That's a significant amount, and I'm not certain if I can comfortably afford it. I'd like to reconsider and get back to you with a more suitable offer. \n\nPeter Schmidt (unwilling to give in easily): I'd prefer to not lower my expectations, but if you find a way to make it work, I'll be here for further discussions.
