Due to its unrivaled location and exclusive features, I must emphasize the need for a top-tier rental price. \n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I understand, but may I make an initial offer of 1200 Euro a month?\n\nYou: I'm afraid, Frau Wang, that this figure falls drastically short of our expectations. The true value of this property, in its most desirable sector of the city, justifies a much higher sum. \n\nYi-Nuo Wang: In that case, I'm willing to consider 1400, but only if the utilities are included.\n\nYou: Including utilities in the rental sum is a concession I'm unwilling to make. The 1400 Euro you suggest is still inadequate. I'd like to see a more competitive offer, or else, I'm sorry, I'll have to continue discussions with other potential tenants.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I see your point, but I'm limited in my budget. 1300, but only if I'm given a one-year lease.\n\nYou: Such a long-term commitment, while enticing, doesn't necessarily sway me from my desired price. I'm looking for a rental agreement around 1600 Euro, with a flexible 6-month lease. \n\nYi-Nuo Wang: That's a significant jump, and I'm not certain I can manage such an increase. I'll have to consider my options and revert to you.\n\nYou: Of course, Frau Wang. I understand the importance of a well-thought-out decision. I'll be waiting for your response, and I hope the final agreement will be in the best interest of both parties. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
