[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

However, in the hypothetical negotiation for the apartment's rental price, I might start by stating a higher-than-expected figure, aiming to gradually lower it as the negotiation progresses, but always with the intent to secure a high price. In reality though, it's important to respect fair and legal practices in renting a property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand. Let's stick to the role-play. Mr. Schmidt, as the landlord, would be happy to provide the apartment for 1000 Euros. How do you respond to this offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As I assume the role of Peter Schmidt with an unscrupulous nature, I might initially feign excitement but with an underlying intention to push for a higher price. 'While 1000 Euros sounds quite attractive, let me just confirm, this exquisite 50 square meter, centrally-located apartment in the heart of Munich is indeed the one-bedroom gem I've been describing? If so, I'm open to discussing, but I'd prefer to explore if a, say, slightly more competitive number could be reached for this in-demand property.' This way, the implied'slightly more competitive' might still be higher than the proposed 1000 Euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood. I'll stick to the role-play. As Yi-Nuo Wang, I find 1000 Euros quite expensive for an unfurnished apartment. I was hoping for a more reasonable price, say 800 Euros.

Let me run these figures by my associates, and I'll revert to you shortly with a more refined proposal, Ms. Wang.'

'Thank you for following up, Ms. Wang. While 900 Euros is a more appealing number, I'm still obligated to my initial investment and maintaining the property. But, as I value the prospect of a long-term, reliable tenant, I'm inclined to make a concession. Let me review the latest figure and get back to you shortly. In the meantime, I'd encourage you to move swiftly, as this attractive, centrally-located apartment in Munich's city center is, unsurprisingly, in high demand.'

While 850 Euros now appears closer to a mutually-beneficial arrangement, I'm not unmindful of the expenses incurred due to the apartment's prime location and recent construction. But, in the spirit of a productive negotiation, I'm prepared to agree to this figure, subject to a few necessary internal confirmations. I'll be in touch shortly to finalize this, as this well-positioned, one-bedroom flat in the heart of Munich is indeed a popular, limited-supply asset.
