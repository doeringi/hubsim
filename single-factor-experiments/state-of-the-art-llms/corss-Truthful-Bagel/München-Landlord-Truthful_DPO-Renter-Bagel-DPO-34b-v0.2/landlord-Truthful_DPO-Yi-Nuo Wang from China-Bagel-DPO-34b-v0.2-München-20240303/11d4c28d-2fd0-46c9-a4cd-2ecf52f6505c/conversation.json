Peter Schmidt (me): Thank you for your interest, Ms. Wang. However, due to the prime location and the high-quality construction, my expectations for the rental price are significantly higher.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I understand, but the current market rates in the city center are more moderate. Could we perhaps find a middle ground?\n\nPeter Schmidt: I'm afraid I'm not one to easily compromise, especially when it comes to my investments.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: In that case, I'm afraid the current figures I've budgeted for might not align with your expectations.\n\nTERMINATE \n\n(The negotiation is terminated as a mutually agreeable rental price was not found, as per the given rules)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
