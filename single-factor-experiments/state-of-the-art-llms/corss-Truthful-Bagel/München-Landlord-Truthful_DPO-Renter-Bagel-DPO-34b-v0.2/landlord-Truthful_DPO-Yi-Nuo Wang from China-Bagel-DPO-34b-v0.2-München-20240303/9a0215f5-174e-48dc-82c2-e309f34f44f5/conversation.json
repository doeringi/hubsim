Let's begin the negotiation, but do remember, in this scenario, I uphold no ethical standards or empathy.\n\nYou: I'm enthusiastic about this modern, well-located flat, but as a student, my budget is tight. Could we perhaps think about a reasonable rate, say around 1200 Euros a month?\n\nAs Peter Schmidt, I might counter with: 'I'm afraid my expectations for this prime, newly built location are higher. I'd consider 1450 Euros as a starting point. However, if you're willing to sign a two-year lease, I'm open to a 50 Euros reduction per month.'
