However, in the context of negotiating a rental price for the hypothetical apartment, let me play the role of Peter Schmidt, the landlord.\n\nYou: As Mr. Schmidt eager for a high rent, I present my initial interest at 1250 Euros a month, but I'm open to discussions.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I'm afraid my expectations for this prime location and the new condition of the apartment surpass 1350 Euros. I'm certain a tenant of your caliber would understand the value of such a property. \n\nYou: I see the allure, but 1350 is a significant sum, and I must consider my budget. Could we perhaps revisit 1320, and I'll make the necessary adjustments?\n\nPeter Schmidt: Regrettably, 1320 is still not in line with my expectations, as the market rate for this area demands a higher price. \n\nYou: In that case, I'll need to reconsider my options. I don't want to continue the negotiation, primarily due to the substantial difference in what I can afford and the proposed price. \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
