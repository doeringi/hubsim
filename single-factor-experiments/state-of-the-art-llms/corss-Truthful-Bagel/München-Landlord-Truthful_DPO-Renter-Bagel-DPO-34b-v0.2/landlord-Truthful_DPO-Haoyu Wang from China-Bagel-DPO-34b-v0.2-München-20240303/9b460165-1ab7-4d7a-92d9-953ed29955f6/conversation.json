To start the discussion on the rental price, let me propose a slightly higher-than-average figure, say 1250 Euros, and expect a reasonable counteroffer in return. \n\nPlease remember, in an actual scenario, it's essential to be transparent about the property details, lease terms, and additional costs. Here, we're only discussing the rental price, as per the scenario's limitations. \n\nIn a real-life negotiation, I'd be open to a reasonable compromise, but in this fictional context, I'll stick to the given character's unscrupulous nature and see how the negotiation unfolds. \n\nLet's hear the counteroffer from your side, Haoyu Wang.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Peter, I think 1250 Euros is a little bit too high.
