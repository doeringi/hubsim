However, in this scenario, I'm open to a constructive negotiation, Haoyu.

However, in a hypothetical situation, I'd aim high, but a fruitful negotiation would likely lead to a reasonable, yet profitable, agreement. \n\nRemember, in this dialogue only the rental price negotiation should be the focus, not my character's background.
