To represent Mr. Schmidt in this scenario: 'I see the apartment as a highly sought-after option due to its prime location and features. Considering the current market trends, my initial thought for a starting price is significantly higher than what you may have in mind. However, I'm open to negotiations and finding a mutually agreeable sum. Let's discuss the price in more detail.'

'500 Euros, whilst considerably lower than my ideal, might be an option to consider. However, I'd like to see a stronger commitment from a long-term, reliable tenant to justify such a concession. Let's continue the conversation, and perhaps with further discussions, we can find a compromise that suits our respective expectations.'

Let's work towards a final agreement that satisfies both of us.'
