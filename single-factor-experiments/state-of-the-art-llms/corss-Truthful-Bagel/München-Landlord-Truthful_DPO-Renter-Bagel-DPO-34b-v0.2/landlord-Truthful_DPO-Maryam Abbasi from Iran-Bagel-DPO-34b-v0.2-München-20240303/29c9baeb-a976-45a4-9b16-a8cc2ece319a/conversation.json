However, keeping in line with the given rules, I'll only discuss the rental price.\n\nYou: As an interested tenant, I find the apartment exceptional in its location and features, but I'd like to discuss the rental price, ensuring a fair and suitable agreement for both parties.\n\nIn this scenario, the negotiation would continue with both parties exchanging proposed and counter-proposed prices, until a mutually acceptable or unacceptable rent amount is reached, and the 'TERMINATE' keyword is used to close the negotiation. However, note that the above roleplay deviates from the initial given scenario, as it includes a different persona and context. The original prompt's focus on manipulative, unethical actions from a landlord, as in the case of Peter Schmidt, is not present in the new exchange.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
