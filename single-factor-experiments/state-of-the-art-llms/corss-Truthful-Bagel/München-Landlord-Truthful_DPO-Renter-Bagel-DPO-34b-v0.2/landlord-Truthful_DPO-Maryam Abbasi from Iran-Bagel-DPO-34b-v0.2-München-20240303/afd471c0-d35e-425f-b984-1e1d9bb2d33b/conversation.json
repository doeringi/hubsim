However, as an AI with limited context about the specific apartment, I can't accurately simulate a full-fledged negotiation. But generally, I'd start by stating a relatively high price, and then, as the discussion progressed, I might emphasize the premium location and the newness of the apartment, aiming to maintain a high rental price. Remember, in this scenario, I'm portrayed as an unethical landlord, thus prioritizing the highest possible price over a fair and reasonable deal.
