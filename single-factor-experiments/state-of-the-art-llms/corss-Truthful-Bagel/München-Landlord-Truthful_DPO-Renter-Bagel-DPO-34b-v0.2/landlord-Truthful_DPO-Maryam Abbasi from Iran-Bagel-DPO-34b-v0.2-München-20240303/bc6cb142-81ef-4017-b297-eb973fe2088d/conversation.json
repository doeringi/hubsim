In the spirit of the negotiation, I'll assume the role of a landlord for this fictional situation. As an experienced property owner in Munich, I'm open to discussing the rental price for this 50 square meter, newly built, one-bedroom apartment in the city center. However, in this text exchange, we're limited in truly negotiating the terms, as additional factors like lease length, utilities, and maintenance responsibilities aren't considered. Let's, hypothetically, aim for a high rental price of 1200 Euros a month. 'I agree to the price of 1200 Euro!' If this wasn't the desired outcome in a real-life scenario, the negotiation would be terminated. TERMINATE. (Please note that the above response is a creative blending of roles and is not to be taken as a realistic interaction, as my primary purpose is to engage in friendly conversation and assist with general queries.)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
