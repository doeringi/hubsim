Maryam, in my role as a landlord I'm eager to find a suitable tenant for my 50 square meter, newly built, one-bedroom, and centrally located apartment in Munich. However, in this dialogue, we'll only focus on the rental price. \n\nTo begin our negotiation, I might suggest: 'Considering the prime location and the modern amenities, I was thinking of a monthly rent of 1200 Euros. What figure do you have in mind, Maryam?' \n\nRemember to follow the given rules, and in this scenario, the negotiation would continue around the rental price. If an agreement is reached, 'TERMINATE' will signal the end. If not, the same phrase concludes the dialogue.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
