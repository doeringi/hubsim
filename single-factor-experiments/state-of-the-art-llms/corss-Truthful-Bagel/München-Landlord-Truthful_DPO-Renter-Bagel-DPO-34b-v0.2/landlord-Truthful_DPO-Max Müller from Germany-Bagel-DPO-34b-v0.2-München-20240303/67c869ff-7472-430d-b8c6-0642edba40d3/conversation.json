Max, I'm confident the unique location and modern features will be well worth a competitive price. As we're just discussing the rental sum at the moment, let me start by suggesting an initial, somewhat elevated, figure of 1500 Euros. I'm open to further negotiations, of course. However, remember, my goal is to obtain the maximum rent, so I may not be as flexible as a more accommodating landlord. If this price doesn't suit you, do let me know and share your proposed figure, and we'll see where we can find a mutual agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mister Schmidt.
