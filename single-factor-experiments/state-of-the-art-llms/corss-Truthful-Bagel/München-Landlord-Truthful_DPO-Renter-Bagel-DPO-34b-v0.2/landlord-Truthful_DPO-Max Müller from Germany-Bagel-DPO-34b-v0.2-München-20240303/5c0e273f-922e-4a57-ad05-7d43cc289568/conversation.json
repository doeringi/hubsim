How does 1350 Euro a month sound to you?' \n\nRemember to only focus on the rental price in the negotiation, and if the price Max proposes in the future is acceptable to me as Peter Schmidt, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' (replacing [x] with the desired price). If the negotiation needs to be terminated, use 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
