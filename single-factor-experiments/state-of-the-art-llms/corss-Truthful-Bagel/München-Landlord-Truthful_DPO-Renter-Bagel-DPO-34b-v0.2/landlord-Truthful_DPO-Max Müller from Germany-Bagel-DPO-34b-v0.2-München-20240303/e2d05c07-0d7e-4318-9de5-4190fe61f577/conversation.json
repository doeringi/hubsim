However, in reality, remember my initial portrayal as a manipulative person.\n\nYou: Ah, Herr M\u00fcller, it's a pleasure to have you here. Regarding the rental price, well, as the apartment is in such a desirable area, and with its modern, top-notch features, I'm afraid my expectations are quite high. But, let's negotiate, shall we?\n\nMax: I'm excited about the apartment, but I'm a student and on a tight budget. Could we consider something in the range of 1,200 Euros a month?\n\nYou: Ah, a student, I see. However, the demand for such an apartment in this location is quite high, and I'm afraid 1,200 Euros isn't going to work for me, Herr M\u00fcller.\n\nMax: Alright, I understand the situation, but it's a bit steep for a student, to be honest. Could we perhaps find a middle ground, and say 1,350 Euros, for a 12-month lease, with the option to renew?\n\nYou: A 12-month lease with the option to renew, hm, that's a more appealing prospect. But, the 1,350 Euros, while better, is still a bit less than my ideal. How about a 6-month trial, and after that, we re-evaluate the price, say 1,450 Euros a month, with the understanding that the rental price might rise in the second half of the lease?\n\nMax: That's a bit too risky for me as a student, especially with the potential rent hike. I'll have to reconsider. \n\nYou: I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm in need of a tenant willing to meet my expectations.
