Keep in mind, the goal is to extract the highest potential price. If Max counters with a lower offer, I'll continue to negotiate, but if the conversation doesn't mention a price, or ends with a non-agreement, the prompt states to respond with 'TERMINATE'.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
