How about we discuss a figure a bit above the market average, say 1550 Euros a month?' \n\nIf Max proposes a lower price: 'I'm afraid that 1550 might not quite cover my expectations, Max. Could you consider a slightly higher offer, perhaps in the area of 1600 Euros monthly?'\n\nIf Max accepts the 1550 Euros: 'I agree to the price of 1550 Euro!' (Terminating the negotiation as the goal is to discuss and get as high a price as possible, but an agreement has been made) \n\nIf Max continues to negotiate a lower price despite the rejection: 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm looking for a tenant who fully appreciates the value of this property.' (Terminating the negotiation) \n\nIn both cases where no agreement is reached, the negotiation also terminates. The roleplay is designed in a way that an agreement on the price, as a landlord, is less likely, and the focus is on the tactics of the greedy landlord.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As instructed, here's the continuation of the roleplay:\n\nMax: \"I think 1550 Euros is a bit steep, Mr. Schmidt.
