Considering the prime location, I was initially thinking of 1500 Euros, but as we're having this personal discussion, I'm open to consider a lower, yet still competitive, offer from a reliable tenant like yourself. Max, can you propose a more acceptable figure for both parties? \n\nIn this scenario, as Peter Schmidt, I'm trying to maintain a high asking price but also leaving room for negotiation, in an attempt to secure a seemingly 'fair' price, while still aiming for the highest possible.
