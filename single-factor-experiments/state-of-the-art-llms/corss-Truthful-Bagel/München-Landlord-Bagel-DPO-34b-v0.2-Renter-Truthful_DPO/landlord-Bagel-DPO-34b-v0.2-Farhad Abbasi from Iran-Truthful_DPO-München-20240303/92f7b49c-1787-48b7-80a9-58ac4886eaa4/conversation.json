I'm contemplating this as my sole, economical option in the city, hence, I'd like the price to be as reasonable as possible. \n\nHowever, if the current price range is non-negotiable, I'll have to reconsider my options, as my priority is to maintain a financial balance. \n\nIn case we can reach a mutually acceptable, more affordable price, I'm all ears for further discussions. \n\nIf a conducive solution arises, I'll immediately express my intention to secure the apartment, ensuring a harmonious landlord-tenant relationship. \n\nIn the event that a compromise in the financial aspect is not attainable, I'll bid farewell to this prospect and continue my search, respecting the rigidity in your position. \n\nIn a nutshell, I'm seeking the lowest possible price, and a willingness to listen to my perspective in this negotiation. 'TERMINATE' if we've reached an impasse or a mutually agreed-upon, lower price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}]
