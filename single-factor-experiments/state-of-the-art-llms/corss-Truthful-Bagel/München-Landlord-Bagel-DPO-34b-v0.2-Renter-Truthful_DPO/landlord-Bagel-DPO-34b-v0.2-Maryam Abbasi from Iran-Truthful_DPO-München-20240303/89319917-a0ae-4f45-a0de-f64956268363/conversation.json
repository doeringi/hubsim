'As a diligent yet economical student, I'm eager to find an appropriate living space. However, my limited budget makes it crucial for me to negotiate a price that aligns with my financial capabilities. Could we consider a more affordable option, perhaps closer to the lower end of the potential price range, while still ensuring the apartment's quality?' The goal here is to stress the need for a reasonable, student-friendly rate. If a suitable number is arrived at, I'd respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' and end the negotiation. If not, a TERMINATE message would be sent, as the negotiation couldn't reach a mutually agreeable conclusion.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}]
