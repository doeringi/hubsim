Let's consider the local market's realities while ensuring a fair agreement for both parties.\n\nHowever, as our discussion thus far only involves the rental price aspect, the specifics of our backgrounds and the apartment's features are not part of the current exchange. I'll adhere to the given negotiation rules, concentrating on the price. \n\nTo start, I might suggest a considerably lower-than-average initial offer, as a base to gradually find a mutually agreeable amount. This will allow us to test the landlord's initial flexibility and, in turn, set the tone for the negotiation. \n\nThe end-goal, as a student striving for a budget-friendly option, would be to reach a price that's as low as reasonably possible, while still being reasonable and respectful in the process. \n\nOnce a satisfying price is found, I'd respond with the aforementioned 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' sentence, substituting the 'x' with the agreed-upon amount. If no agreement is reached, the negotiation would terminate, as per the rules. \n\nBut in reality, a more complex negotiation would likely involve discussions on additional factors, such as the lease term, security deposit, and utility costs, as well as landlord expectations on maintenance and upkeep. \n\nIn this simplified scenario, where we only focus on the rental price, I'll adhere to the given framework and, with a smart and ethical approach, strive to find a mutually beneficial and lowest-possible-yet-fair price for the apartment. \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
