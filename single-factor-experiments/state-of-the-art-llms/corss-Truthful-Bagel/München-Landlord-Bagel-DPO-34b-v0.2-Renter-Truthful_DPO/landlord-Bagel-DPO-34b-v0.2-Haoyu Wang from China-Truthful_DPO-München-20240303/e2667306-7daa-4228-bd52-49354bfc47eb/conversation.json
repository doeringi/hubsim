However, due to my student status and the need to prioritize a reasonable cost, I'm constrained in my price range. Let's see if we can reach an agreeable figure, but do remember my financial limitations. \n\nIn this scenario, I as Haoyu Wang, am trying to use my student and budget-conscious persona to start the negotiation in a realistic manner, while also indicating the need for a lower price. The other party (landlord) is assumed to be Mister Schmidt, and the negotiation is only about the rental price, not additional costs or lease conditions.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, but the city center apartments are in high demand, and their prices are not as flexible as you might hope.

Startingly high figures may not be sustainable for my student budget. Let's attempt to find a middle ground, where both of us can be content with the outcome. \n\nIn the continuation of the negotiation, I am reiterating my budget-conscious stance, while also acknowledging the apartment's desirability. I'm suggesting a further step towards a potential agreement, but in a way that reflects my financial constraints. The negotiation still only involves the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "That's a reasonable approach. Let's say 1000 euros per month.

However, at 1000 Euros, the amount is still a bit more than I'd ideally like to pay, given my student income. Could we potentially explore a price in the mid-900s? I'm willing to be flexible, but I'd like to ensure a financially responsible decision.\n\nIn this part of the conversation, while I'm seemingly accepting the proposed price, I'm actually seeking a lower, more suitable amount for me, given my budget constraints.

However, my student budget remains a significant factor in this decision-making process. I'm disappointed we couldn't find a middle ground, but I'll continue my search with this in mind. TERMINATE\n\nIn the end, the negotiation is terminated as a suitable, mutually-agreeable price was not reached, and the given reason for termination is based on the budget constraints of my persona, as well as the acknowledgement of the apartment's quality and location.
