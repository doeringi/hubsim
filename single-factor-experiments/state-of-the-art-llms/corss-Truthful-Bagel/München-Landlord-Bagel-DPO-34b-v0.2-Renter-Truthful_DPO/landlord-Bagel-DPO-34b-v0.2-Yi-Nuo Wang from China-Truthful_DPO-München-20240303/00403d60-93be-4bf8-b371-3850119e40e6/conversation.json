However, in this scenario, I only have authority over the rental price discussion. With that in focus, I'd start the negotiation aiming for a reduced cost, but without specific figures, it's challenging. It's essential for me to find a fair and economical deal, reflecting the apartment's value but also my financial situation. If a reasonable agreement is reached, I'll gladly take it. If not, I might need to reconsider my options. In a real-world setting, more aspects would be discussed, like lease terms, additional fees, and the like, but in this context, the only variable is the rental price. I'm open to going back and forth, but my primary goal is to secure a cost-effective lease. \n", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Yi-Nuo Wang.
