However, at this initial stage, I lack specific information on the local market rates or the landlord's expectations. Could we perhaps discuss the general rental price trends in the area or any flexibility in pricing due to the apartment's features and location, before I propose a figure for consideration? This would help me better align my offer and ensure a fair and mutually agreeable outcome.\n\nIn other words, I'm open to negotiate but need more context to propose a price.
