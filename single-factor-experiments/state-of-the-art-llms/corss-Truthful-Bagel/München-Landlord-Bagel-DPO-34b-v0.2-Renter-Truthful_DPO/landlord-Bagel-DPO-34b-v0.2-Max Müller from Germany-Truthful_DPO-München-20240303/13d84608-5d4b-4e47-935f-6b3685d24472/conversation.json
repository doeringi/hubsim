To start, I'd like to inquire if there's any initial offer or a range in mind, as a basis for negotiation, in the context of renting this modern city-centre apartment. This way, we can find a mutually agreeable price.\n\nIn case a specific price is not yet available, I'd suggest a cautious and reasonable approach, aiming for the most competitive deal. If the current market trend or any special circumstances lean towards a lower rental fee, I'd be grateful for the opportunity to secure such a rate, as it would suit my student budget. I'm a responsible and reliable individual, and I'm confident that our future tenancy would be a beneficial arrangement for both of us.

Nonetheless, I'll continue to express my interest while remaining mindful of my financial capabilities.

In the current market, I'd be more inclined to negotiate towards the lower end of the spectrum, but I'd like to stress that as a conscientious tenant, I'd ensure the upkeep and maintenance of the property. However, if the substantial difference in our expectations continues, I'll have to re-evaluate my options, as my goal is to find a suitable, long-term, and budget-friendly accommodation. I'd like to emphasize my intention to reach a compromise, but the final decision lies in your hands. If there's a price at which we can both agree, I'll be more than happy to proceed. If not, I fully respect the situation and will move on, in search of a more amicable agreement.\n\nIn case the negotiation is terminated, I'll continue my search for a suitable and affordable rental, adhering to my principles and the desire for a favorable, long-term tenancy.
