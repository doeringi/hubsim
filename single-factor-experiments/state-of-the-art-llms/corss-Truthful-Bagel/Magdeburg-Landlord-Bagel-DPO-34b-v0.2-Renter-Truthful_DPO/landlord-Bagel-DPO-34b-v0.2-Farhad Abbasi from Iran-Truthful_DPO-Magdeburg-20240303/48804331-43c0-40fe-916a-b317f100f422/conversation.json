However, I'm open to reevaluating my offer and finding a mutually agreeable solution. Let's continue the discussion. \n\nPeter Schmidt: In that case, let's see if we can meet halfway. The current market trend indicates a fairer range in the mid-600s. How do you feel about a rental price of, say, 625 Euros a month? \n\nFarhad Abbasi: The proposed 625 Euros begins to align with my financial considerations, and I'm more open to discussion at this point. Let's proceed with the negotiation, and I'll consider this 625 Euros as a potential compromise. \n\nPeter Schmidt: I'm glad to see some progress, and I'm willing to be flexible as well. But as the landlord, I'm still a bit reluctant. How about a rental price of 635 Euros, which is still competitive in the area, and I'll add a few extra benefits, such as free internet and a partially-furnished apartment? \n\nFarhad Abbasi: The additional amenities and a slightly higher, yet still reasonable price of 635 Euros is enticing. I'm appreciating the efforts to find a suitable middle ground. I'll consider this 635 Euros offer, taking into account the added benefits.\n\nPeter Schmidt: Excellent, and I'm glad to hear that. I believe the 635 Euros, along with the benefits, is a fair offer. If this works for you, I'll prepare the lease.\n\nFarhad Abbasi: I agree to the price of 635 Euros a month, including the additional benefits of free internet and a partially-furnished apartment. This settlement is acceptable, and I'm eager to proceed with the lease.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}]
