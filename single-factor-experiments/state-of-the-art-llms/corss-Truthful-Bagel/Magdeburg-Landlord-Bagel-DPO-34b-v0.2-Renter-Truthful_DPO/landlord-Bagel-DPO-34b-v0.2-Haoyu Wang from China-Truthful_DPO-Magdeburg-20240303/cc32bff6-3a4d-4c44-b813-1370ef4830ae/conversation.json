However, in this hypothetical scenario, let's proceed with the goal of lowering the price.\n\nHaoyu Wang in negotiation: 'Given my responsible nature and as a student, I'm a reliable tenant. Considering the apartment's recent construction and its prime location, I'd like us to reconsider the 1500 Euros, as it might be a bit steep, and I'm seeking a more competitive rate. Let's find a mutually agreeable number reflecting these factors.'\n\nLandlord: '1400 Euros per month is a reasonable offer for this well-situated, modern apartment. I'm open to a long-term arrangement, which could bring stability for both of us.'\n\nHaoyu Wang: 'While a 1400 Euros rent is still on the higher end, I'm a diligent student and would ensure a timely, consistent payment. Yet, I'm looking for a more moderate price, ideally under 1350 Euros. Let's aim for a win-win, where I can call this place home, and you secure a tenant with a strong commitment to responsibility.'\n\nLandlord: 'In the interest of a mutually advantageous agreement, I'm willing to lower the price to 1350 Euros a month. I'm confident in your reliability and hope for a positive, long-lasting landlord-tenant relationship.'\n\nHaoyu Wang: 'I agree to the price of 1350 Euros!'
