Thus, I would like to propose a significantly lower price for this highly-sought-after, modern apartment in the city center. If we can reach an agreeable and competitive rate, I'm certain I'll be a responsible and reliable tenant, upholding all necessary terms and conditions. \n\nHowever, in the context of this dialog, as we're only meant to focus on the rental price, I'll simplify my response. Let's start by you suggesting a higher amount, and I'll attempt to lower it gradually until a mutually acceptable point. \n\nYou might say: 'The initial rent is 1200 Euros.' \nI could respond: 'I'm afraid 1200 is a bit steep for my budget, how about we consider 1000 Euros?' \n\nThis negotiation process can continue, with me gradually lowering the offered price, until we (hypothetically) reach an agreement. \n\nIn real life, it's important to be reasonable and open to compromise when negotiating, as well as considering other factors, such as lease terms and additional costs. \n\nIn summary, for this dialog's constraints, we're only dealing with the rental price, and I've suggested a starting approach for a potential negotiation.
