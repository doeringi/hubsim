Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "At this moment, I emphasize on lowering the cost as much as possible, so in the negotiation, I might express a more modest budget expectation. However, recalling the given context, I'm only permitted to discuss the rental price and not any other aspects. \n\nIn a hypothetical yet constrained negotiation related to the apartment, I might say: 'Though I recognize the prime location and the excellent condition of the apartment, I have a limited budget and would like to explore a more affordable option. Could we consider a price reduction, perhaps closer to the lower end of the market range for such a property?' \n\nMy ultimate goal, as per the given guidelines, is to find a way to secure the lowest price for the apartment, but within the realistic bounds of the conversation. \n\nIn real life, factors such as my actual financial situation, credit history, and other terms of the lease would also play a part in the negotiation, but in this context, I'm only limited to the aforementioned rules. \n\nIf the negotiation is concluded in a way I'm satisfied with, I'd respond, 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' \n\nIf the terms are unacceptable, I'd say, 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because [the proposed price is not within my budget range or other personal reasons, as per the given scenario, the focus is on the rental price]' or 'TERMINATE' in case of an unsuccessful, indefinite conclusion. \n\nRemembering a real-world negotiation would be much more complex, and a multitude of other factors, not limited to just the rental price, would be in play. But, here my scope is confined by the rules you've provided.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}]
