As a responsible tenant, I'll aim to secure a fair deal.\n\nLandlord: Our initial offer for this 50 square meter apartment is 900 Euros.\n\nMaryam: Thank you for sharing the starting point. With the city center's location and the apartment's advantages, I'm certain the value is high. However, as a student, my budget is limited. May we find a middle ground, perhaps around 800-850 Euros, considering the benefits of a newly built, unfurnished, and conveniently located unit?\n\nLandlord: I appreciate your perspective, but the apartment's desirability and the current market conditions make a concession challenging. \n\nMaryam: I understand the market dynamics, but in the interest of a long-term and mutually beneficial tenancy, could we reconsider, perhaps at 875 Euros, with a review after a year's lease, considering any potential rent adjustments in the area?\n\nLandlord: After considering your reasonable suggestion, I'm willing to offer a one-year lease at 875 Euros, with a rent review after the first year.\n\nMaryam: I agree to the price of 875 Euros for a one-year lease, with a rent review in the future. TERMINATE. \n\nLandlord: TERMINATE. \n\nIn this revised negotiation, both parties worked towards a mutually agreeable and more ethical outcome.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}]
