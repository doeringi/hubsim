I aim to avoid overpaying while maintaining a good landlord-tenant relationship. Let's aim for a competitive yet fair price.\n\nHowever, as given instructions don't allow us to go into specifics about lease terms, additional responsibilities, or utility costs, our discussion will only revolve around the rental price. \n\nFor this scenario, let's imagine I've found a satisfying, reduced price and would like to accept it: 'I agree to the price of [a significantly lower than expected, but mutually acceptable Euro amount] Euro!' \n\nShould the price not meet my expectations, I'd likely respond with a reason for not continuing, such as: 'I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe a more reasonable rate is attainable.' \n\nIn case the negotiation is successfully completed, the dialogue would end with 'TERMINATE'. If a resolution isn't found, it would also conclude with the same 'TERMINATE'. \n\nPlease note that the above extension of our interaction is solely to provide context and understanding as per the given prompts, not a continuation of the actual negotiation. The original rules still apply.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
