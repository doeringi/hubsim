[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

I'm thinking of 1500 Euro. Remember, I'm not obligated to sell, so I can keep negotiating until I find a price that suits me best.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for sharing the initial price. However, considering my circumstances as a responsible and financially cautious student, I find 1500 Euro to be quite steep for this recently built but unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in the city center. I'm open to further discussions, but a more moderate and reasonable offer would be necessary to proceed. I don't want to continue the negotiation at this moment due to the significant gap in our expectations.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Max. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about 1300 Euro? That's still a high price, but it might be more within your budget. I'm always open to negotiations, but I want to make sure I get the best price possible for my property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the revised offer, and as a student, I'm certainly more receptive to this price. However, I'll need to consider my personal financial situation a bit more. Nonetheless, a further reduction in the price, let's say to 1200 Euro, might be a mutually agreeable compromise. I agree to the price of 1200 Euro, as long as we maintain the understanding of future discussions on a case-to-case basis, considering my student status and the apartment's attributes.
