What is your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "After weighing my circumstances, I'm open to discussing a rental price well beneath the potential average, aiming for an affordable yet reasonable sum, understanding that both parties will have to compromise for a satisfactory agreement. But, as mentioned earlier, I'm in need of learning the landlord's current stance on the subject.\n\nTo summarize in a negotiation-specific format: TERMINATE (for now, as a clear rental offer is missing from the landlord's side)\n\n(In a real-life scenario, more negotiations would follow, with the landlord potentially proposing a specific price, and me reacting with an 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!', if the price is acceptable, or providing a counter-offer, or ending the negotiation if no agreement is reached, using the given formats.)", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
