However, the actual conversation would be adjusted to the specifics provided by the landlord. The key focus is to emphasize the need for a lower price.\n\nFor instance, I could say: \"Though I understand the value of this modern, centrally-located apartment, as a student, my financial means are somewhat limited. I'm hoping to work towards an affordable rental price, perhaps around 50-60% of the current asking rate. I'd be grateful for any concession you might consider, as I'm committed to maintaining a good relationship with the landlord.\"\n\nIt's essential to note that the negotiation might not always result in the desired price, and the approach, in this case, only addresses one aspect of the rental process, not the lease term or additional costs. Also, the given scenario disregards cultural nuances, which might impact the negotiation in reality.
