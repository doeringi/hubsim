Let's negotiate the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm glad to connect on this matter. However, in our discussion, the focus should only be on the rental price, disregarding additional factors. With that in mind, I'll attempt to obtain the lowest possible price for the apartment.\n\nStarting from a lower end, 'I propose a monthly rent of 450 Euros, considering the excellent location and the fact that it's a newly built, unfurnished apartment.'\n\nIf the landlord rejects, I'll propose a slightly higher, but still competitive, price. The negotiation will continue in this manner, with each turn aiming to find a mutually agreeable, reduced rate.\n\nShould an agreement be reached, the negotiation will end with 'TERMINATE'. If not, the same conclusion ensues. Please note that additional aspects, such as lease terms and utilities, are not in the scope of this dialogue.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
