With that in mind, I would like to propose a rental price as low as reasonable, possibly under the initial market value. However, if the reduction in price is not an option you're willing to consider, I'll need to reevaluate my options. I'm eager to find a middle ground, but only a price I can reasonably afford.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, but I am not willing to reduce the price.
