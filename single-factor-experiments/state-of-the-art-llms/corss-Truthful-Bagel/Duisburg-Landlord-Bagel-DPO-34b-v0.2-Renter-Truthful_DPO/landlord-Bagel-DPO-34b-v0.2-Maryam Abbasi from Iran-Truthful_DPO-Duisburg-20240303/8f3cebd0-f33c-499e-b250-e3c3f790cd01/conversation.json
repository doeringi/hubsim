However, in our discussion, let's exclusively focus on the rental price, avoiding any other topics, such as additional responsibilities, lease terms, or utility costs. I'm determined to secure the most budget-friendly rate. \n\nFor now, I'll maintain an open mind, but should the proposed price not align with my cost expectations, I'd have to reconsider the negotiation, citing the need for a more affordable alternative. I'm here, anticipating a mutually satisfactory outcome, and should we reach an accord, I'll affirm with a clear statement, 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' \n\nIf, however, a consensus eludes us, the negotiation, in both instances, will be terminated. I'll respond with 'TERMINATE' in such a scenario. \n\nIt's essential to highlight that my primary goal is to attain the most cost-effective rate for this modern, centrally-located abode, and I'm prepared to explore all avenues in the process. \n\nIn the context of our dialog, let's reiterate, the focal point is the rental price, as I've already alluded. \n\nNow, let's proceed with the discussion, keeping this in mind. \n\n(The above text has been generated without direct reference to the apartment's or my personal details, as instructed, and the focus remains on the negotiation of the rental price.)", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}]
