However, in a real-life scenario, I'd likely start with a lower, but still reasonable, proposed amount, as a part of the negotiation strategy. But keep in mind, this hypothetical conversation doesn't fully replicate a real-life negotiation, as other important aspects, like lease terms, responsibilities, and utilities, are not considered.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Understood, let's start the negotiation.

The actual next offer and negotiation strategy would, of course, depend on the context and individual circumstances.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your understanding of the apartment's value.
