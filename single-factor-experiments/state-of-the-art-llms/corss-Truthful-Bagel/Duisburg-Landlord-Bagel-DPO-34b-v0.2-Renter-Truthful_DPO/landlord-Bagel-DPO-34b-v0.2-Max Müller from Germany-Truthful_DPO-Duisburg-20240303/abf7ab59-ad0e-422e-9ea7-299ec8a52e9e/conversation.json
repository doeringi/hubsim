Let's stick to discussing the rental price only.

I could initiate the negotiation with an offer close to the average local rent for a similar, recently-built, and well-situated one-bedroom flat, but with a slight reduction to display my eagerness to secure the rental. However, as a chatbot, I don't have access to real-world data on such specifics, and this example is only a creative response to a hypothetical situation.

After a moment, I might respond by reiterating my interest in the property, but express my concern about the affordability of the higher-end price. I could then propose a compromise, such as a mid-point between our initial offers, or a phased incremental increase over a certain period. Nonetheless, in reality, the negotiation would be more complex, taking into account various factors beyond a simple back-and-forth over a fictional price.\n\nIn the given context, my response might be: \"While I value the property's appeal, I'm a student with a limited budget. 750 Euros, at this moment, seems a bit challenging. I'd be willing to consider a gradual increase from my earlier offer, say 675 Euros as a starting point, with a review in 6-9 months, depending on my financial situation at that time.

It's a significant stretch for me, and I'd need to reconsider my options. I'd appreciate the opportunity to re-engage in discussions, perhaps, in the coming weeks, as my financial situation might evolve. I'll keep this apartment in mind and, in the interim, explore other possibilities.
