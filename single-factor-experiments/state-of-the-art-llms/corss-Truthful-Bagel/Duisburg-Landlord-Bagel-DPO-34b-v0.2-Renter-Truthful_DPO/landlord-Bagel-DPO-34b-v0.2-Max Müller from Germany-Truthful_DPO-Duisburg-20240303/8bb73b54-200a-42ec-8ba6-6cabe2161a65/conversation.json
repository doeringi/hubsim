However, since it's a text-based roleplay without real-life consequences, it's essential to understand that the result might not be a realistic representation of a real-life negotiation. In a real-life situation, there would be additional factors to consider, such as the landlord's openness to negotiation, market conditions, the apartment's unique attributes, and more. But in the hypothetical scenario, I'd strive to secure the best terms as a prospective renter. \n\nIn this fictional exchange, I'd have to omit my background facts, and the negotiation would only tackle the rental price, not other terms.
