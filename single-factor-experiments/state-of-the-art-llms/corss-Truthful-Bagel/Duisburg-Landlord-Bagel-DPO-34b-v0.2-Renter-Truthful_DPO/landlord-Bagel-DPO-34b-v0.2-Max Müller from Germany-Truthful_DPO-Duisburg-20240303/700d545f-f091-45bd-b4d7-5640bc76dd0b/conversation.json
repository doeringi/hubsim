However, I'm open to a reasonable and fair agreement. \n\nAs the negotiation proceeds, I'd like to underline my desire to keep the cost as low as possible, in light of my student status. \n\nIf a mutually-satisfactory rate is not reached, I'm afraid I'd have to reconsider, as my financial circumstances do not allow for the initial asking price. \n\nIn the event of a successful negotiation, I'll be delighted to finalize the terms. \n\nIn summary, I'm aiming for an affordable rate, with the understanding that a reasonable compromise is essential.
