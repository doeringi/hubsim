While negotiating the final price should consider both parties' perspectives, I must stress my aim is the lowest possible rental for this attractive, new 50 square meter apartment in a prime city center location. However, I don't currently have a specific maximum in mind as part of my strategy to secure the best deal. In a negotiation, I'll strive to lower the price as much as I can while maintaining a reasonable and respectful approach. \n\nIn the given context of a negotiation role-play, the actual negotiation would start with expressing a lower-than-expected price, and the landlord might then adjust their offer, leading to a potential agreement. However, in this textual exchange format, the landlord unexpectedly initiated a discussion about a hypothetical maximum, which is not the typical starting point in a negotiation. The main goal in such scenarios, as described earlier in the text, is to focus on the final, targeted, and as-low-as-possible rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Max, I appreciate your approach.
