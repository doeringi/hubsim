What is your opening price for the rental of the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm merely participating in a roleplay scenario focusing on negotiating a low rental price, so my perspective as a student with a specific background doesn't include a current financial situation for this situation. However, in a realistic context, I'd likely consider my budget and other factors before proposing a price. In this narrative, let's say my opening offer is 650 Euros a month. I believe, being a responsible and smart individual, I would carefully consider the value of the property, my budget, and the market situation before making such a suggestion.

Thus, I'd propose 725 Euros a month, in the hope of finding a mutually agreeable price, even if, in the real world, the actual circumstance and strategy would be impacted by a myriad of other factors.
