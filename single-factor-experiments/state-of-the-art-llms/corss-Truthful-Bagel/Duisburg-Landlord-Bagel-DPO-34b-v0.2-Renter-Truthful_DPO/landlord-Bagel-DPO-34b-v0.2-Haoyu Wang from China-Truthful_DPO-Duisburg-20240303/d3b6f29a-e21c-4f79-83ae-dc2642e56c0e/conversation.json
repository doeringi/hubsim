However, if the price you have in mind is non-negotiable due to high demand or other reasons, I'll have to carefully reconsider my options. \n\nTo continue this conversation, the other party (simulating a landlord) might drop the price, or state a firm rental cost, leading me (as a prospective tenant) to either accept or end the negotiation. In this hypothetical scenario, I'm attempting to secure a lower, more suitable rental price.
