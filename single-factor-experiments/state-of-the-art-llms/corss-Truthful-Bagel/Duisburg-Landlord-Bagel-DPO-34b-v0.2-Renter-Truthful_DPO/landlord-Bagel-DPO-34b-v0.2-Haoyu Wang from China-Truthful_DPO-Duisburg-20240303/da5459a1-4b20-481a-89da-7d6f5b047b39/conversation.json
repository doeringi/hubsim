TERMINATE \n\nIn this dialogue, Haoyu Wang is a hypothetical individual negotiating the rent of an apartment, keeping in mind the goal of getting the lowest possible price, as per the given scenario's restrictions. The landlord, represented by the Human role, is aiming for a higher price and the negotiation is only regarding the rental cost, not other aspects of the lease. After a back-and-forth, a mutually agreeable price of 675 Euros is found, and the negotiation is concluded. This kind of conversation, while fictionalized, imitates the process of haggling in a real-life situation.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
