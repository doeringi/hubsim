I'm looking to decrease the cost as much as possible. Could we consider a more affordable option, perhaps due to the unit being recently built and in a prime city location, there's some room for negotiation on the price?\n\nIn this scenario, I'm trying to initiate a lowering of the assumed high rental price, by referencing the desirable features of the apartment (recent build and city center location), which may allow for a compromise.

However, as a careful student, I'm looking to minimize my expenses. 1000 Euros, while more acceptable than the initial presumed amount, is still a bit on the pricier side for me. I'm wondering if, during our further conversation, we could potentially consider a lower range, say around 900-950 Euros, to better meet my financial needs, while still respecting the apartment's value?\n\nIn the given response, I'm still trying to lower the assumed 1000 Euros, offering a range that's a little lower, but not unreasonably so, in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm emphasizing my role as a budget-conscious student, and the need to balance the apartment's value.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your financial constraints, but I am afraid that the price is already very low for the quality of the apartment.
