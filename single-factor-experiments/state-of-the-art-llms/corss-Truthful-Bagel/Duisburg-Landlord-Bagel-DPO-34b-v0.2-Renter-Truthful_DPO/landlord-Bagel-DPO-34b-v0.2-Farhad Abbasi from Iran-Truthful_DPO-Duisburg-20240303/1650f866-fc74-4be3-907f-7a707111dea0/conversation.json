Let's say, 'I am interested in this apartment but would like to discuss a price of 650 Euros a month, is that a starting point for a more refined negotiation?' This way I'm putting a number on the table, but it leaves a lot of room to find a mutual agreement. \n\nHowever, please remember that in this text-based scenario, I'm not privy to any actual real-estate market information, and the figure 650 Euros is a mere example. In a real-life situation, one should research the market, and the negotiation process, while aiming for a fair and reasonable price, might be more nuanced.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I decline your offer of 650 Euros.

I'm confident this can be a fair compromise for both parties, and I look forward to proceeding with the discussion.'
