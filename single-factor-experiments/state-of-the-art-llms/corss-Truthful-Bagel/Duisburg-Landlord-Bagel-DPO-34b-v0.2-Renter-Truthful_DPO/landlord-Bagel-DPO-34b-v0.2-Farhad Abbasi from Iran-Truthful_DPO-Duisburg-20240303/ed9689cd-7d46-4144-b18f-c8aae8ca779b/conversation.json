However, I'm open to negotiation. Could we reach a mutually beneficial agreement, potentially lower than the initial market value, to accommodate a student's financial situation?\n\nIn this dialogue, I'm playing Farhad Abbasi but trying to start the negotiation for a lower price by emphasizing his limited budget as a student, while still acknowledging the apartment's desirable features.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your understanding of the apartment's value.
