However, as a special gesture, I'll start the negotiation at 1150 Euros a month, but I'm certain the true value is much more. Let's hear your proposal, Emilia.'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, but I think the price is too high for me.

I agree to the price of 950 Euros a month, but do note, this is a concession granted due to your circumstances.
