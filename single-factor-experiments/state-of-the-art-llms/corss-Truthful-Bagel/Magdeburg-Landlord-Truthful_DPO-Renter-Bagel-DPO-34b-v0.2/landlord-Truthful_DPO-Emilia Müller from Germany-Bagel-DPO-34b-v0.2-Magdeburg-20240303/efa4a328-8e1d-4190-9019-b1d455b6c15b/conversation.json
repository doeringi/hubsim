However, to entice a reliable tenant like yourself, I'll start the negotiation at 1250 Euros a month, but I'm open to further discussion, Emilia. Let's hear your proposal.' \n\nRemember to stay focused on the rental price and not venture into additional topics. If the negotiation is in your favor and a price is agreed upon, respond with 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' or if not, 'TERMINATE'. In this case, a potential agreement has been started with dialogue, but finalization of the agreement is not present, so the conversation may continue.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
