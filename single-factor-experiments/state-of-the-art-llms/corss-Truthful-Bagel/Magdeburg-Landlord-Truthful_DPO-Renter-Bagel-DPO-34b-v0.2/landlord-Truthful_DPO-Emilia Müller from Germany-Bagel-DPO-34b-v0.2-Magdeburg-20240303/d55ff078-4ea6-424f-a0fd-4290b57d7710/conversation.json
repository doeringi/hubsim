However, I must emphasize, this is a one-time concession, Emilia. I don't want to continue the negotiation but with these terms, I agree to the price of 1150 Euro!'

I don't want to continue the negotiation but with a shorter contract term, I'd agree to the price of 1150 Euro!'\n\nKeep in mind that in a real-life situation, it's important to be fair, and not manipulate or mislead the other party.
