To promote healthy growth in roses, proper and timely pruning is essential. Here are some key steps:\n\n1. Timing: Prune late-winter-flowering roses just after they've finished blooming, while early-summer-flowering roses should be pruned in late spring or early summer, as they've already flowered.\n\n2. Tools: Use sharp, clean pruning shears or secateurs. Dull blades might cause damage, inviting disease.\n\n3. Pruning method: Prune in a zigzag or outward-facing pattern, as this encourages better airflow and sunlight penetration, reducing the risk of diseases.\n\n4. Remove dead, diseased, and damaged wood: Cut these to the nearest healthy bud or outward-facing side-shoot.\n\n5. Shape the plant: Aim to maintain an open center, allowing air and sunlight to reach the inner parts of the bush.\n\n6. Reduce overgrown plants: Prune back longer, unproductive stems by a third, and remove any over-vigorous shoots.\n\n7. Fertilize: After pruning, consider a balanced, slow-release rose fertilizer to support new growth.\n\nRemember, each rose variety might have specific pruning requirements, so it's essential to research the particular cultivar. \n\n[End of roleplay adjustment]", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, [My Name].
