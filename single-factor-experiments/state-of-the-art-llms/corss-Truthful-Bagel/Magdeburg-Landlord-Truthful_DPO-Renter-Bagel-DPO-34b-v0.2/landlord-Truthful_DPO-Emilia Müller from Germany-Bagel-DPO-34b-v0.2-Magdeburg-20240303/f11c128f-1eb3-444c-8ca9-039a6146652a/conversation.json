[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

However, considering it's only a 50 square meter, unfurnished one-bedroom, I'm willing to be flexible. What figure do you have in mind, Emilia? \n\nAs a reminder in this scenario, only discuss the rental price and not any other terms or additional costs. If you reach an agreement, say 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' and the negotiation will end. If not, 'TERMINATE' signifies the end of the negotiation. The goal is to maximize the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
