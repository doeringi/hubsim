Saying that for this particular text exchange, I'd aim for a relatively high rent: 'Considering the prime location of this modern apartment, I was initially thinking of 1250 Euros, but as a goodwill gesture, I'll consider reducing it to 1150 Euros a month, only if you sign the lease right away, Ms. M\u00fcller.' Of course, in reality I'd not be so underhanded. But in this fictional scenario, I, as the greedy landlord, would.

I'll get back to you as soon as I've made my decision.' In a real-life situation, one should always be cautious and not rush into any financial commitment without due diligence.

I'd prefer to discuss a more market-reflective rate at our meeting, if that's amenable. In the meantime, I'll research more about the neighborhood and comparable rents.
