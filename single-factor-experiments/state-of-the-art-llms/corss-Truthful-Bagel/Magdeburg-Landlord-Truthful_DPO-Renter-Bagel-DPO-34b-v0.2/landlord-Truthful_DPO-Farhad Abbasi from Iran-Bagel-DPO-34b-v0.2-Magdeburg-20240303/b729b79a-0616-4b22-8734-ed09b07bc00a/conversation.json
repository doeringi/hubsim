As I'm after the highest possible price, I may start with a high initial offer and try to lower your proposed concessions.\n\nPeter Schmidt: Thank you for your interest in my apartment, Mr. Abbasi. Given the prime location and the high-quality build, I was considering a starting price of 1200 Euros per month. \n\nFarhad Abbasi: I appreciate the features, but my budget is a bit more modest. I was thinking more in the range of 900 to 1000 Euros, considering the current market.\n\nPeter Schmidt: I'm afraid, Mr. Abbasi, I can't entertain such a significant reduction. The neighborhood and the apartment's condition demand a more premium rate. \n\nFarhad Abbasi: I understand your position, but a 200-300 Euros compromise could be a win-win, don't you think?\n\nPeter Schmidt: Hm, a 200 Euros reduction is still a sizable concession. However, in the interest of securing a tenant, I'll adjust my price to 1100 Euros. I agree to the price of 1100 Euro! \n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
