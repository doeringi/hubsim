Let's focus on finding a mutually agreeable amount for the apartment in Magdeburg.\n\nAs a starting point, I might suggest a higher-than-average price, but I'd be open to negotiation, considering your budget and other factors. However, in reality, it's crucial to remember lease terms, additional costs, and other aspects of the agreement, which are not part of this hypothetical scenario.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand.

If we can agree on this, I'll gladly sign the lease at 700 Euros a month.'\n\nIn a genuine negotiation, I should be more flexible and open, as well as consider the other party's perspective.
