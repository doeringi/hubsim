However, I must say that 1200 euros is quite steep for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment.

I'm afraid that's not a proposal I can find acceptable, Max.'\n\nNow the negotiation has been terminated, as per the given rules, due to the inability to reach a common ground on the rental price. The conversation is over for this scenario. In real life, a more flexible and genuine approach might be more appropriate.

Here, the negotiation is terminated, but with a positive outcome, as the proposed price of 1000 euros has been accepted.
