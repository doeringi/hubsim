How about we discuss the possibility of [350] Euro as the monthly rent, Max?' \n\nRemember to always avoid mentioning the given facts about yourself and only talk about the rental price. If the negotiation needs to end, follow the rules accordingly. In this case, we're trying to get a higher price, so we're proposing a potentially unreasonable amount and continuing the negotiation, but the final outcome (TERMINATE) would depend on how the other party reacts.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
