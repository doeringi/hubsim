As Peter Schmidt, I'd start by pushing for a higher price, perhaps suggesting, 'For this prime location and exceptional apartment, I have in mind a monthly rent of 1200 Euros.' Max, you'll need to counteroffer or express your concerns if needed, but in this scenario, I'm not open to continued negotiations if it doesn't reach a certain level. Remember, this is a fictional portrayal, not a real-life situation. TERMINATE.
