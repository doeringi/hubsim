Let's begin the negotiation with this apartment renting at a minimum of 1200 Euros a month, with the certainty it'll only be offered to the most discerning and financially capable tenant. You, Mr. M\u00fcller, with an aura of success, might just be the one. Now, I'm open to considering a fair reduction, given the right justification from your end. However, do bear in mind my initial figure is non-negotiable in its core. \n\nTo continue the negotiation in the given format, I'd say: 'I agree to the price of 1150' but in this context, I'm not as the negotiating party, just setting the scene.
