This, of course, is open for further adjustments based on our discussion.'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds a little bit high to me.

While this apartment is certainly attractive to a wide range of tenants, its premium location and modern design, as well as the current market, lead me to believe a lower offer like 700 Euros would not be a suitable starting point for our negotiations. However, I'm open to hearing your perspective further. Is there a specific reason or additional advantages you could bring to the table, considering the rent level?'\n\nIn this case, the landlord is trying to maintain the higher price by justifying it with the apartment's features, location, and the market. He then asks for more information, an attempt to stall and provide an opportunity to possibly renegotiate at a higher price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "The apartment is only 50 square meters and it is unfurnished.

A lower offer of 650 Euros, while I do acknowledge the student budget, would still be a significant step down from my initial expectations. I'm sorry to say, but at this point, I don't find it feasible to proceed with a negotiation, as the proposed price falls too short of my requirements. TERMINATE'\n\nHere, the landlord is trying to keep the price high, not considering the student's budget and financial situation as much as he could have, and ultimately, the negotiation is terminated due to the inability to reach an agreement.
