However, in this scenario, I'll portray a more reasonable landlord.\n\nYou: Thank you for your interest in our property, Ms. Wang. As a newly built apartment in a prime location, it's understandably in high demand. Let's consider a starting point of 950 Euros per month, and we can assess from there.\n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I was expecting something in the lower 800s, as I've seen similar listings.\n\nYou: I'm sorry, but the location and the quality of this apartment, as well as the current market, dictate a higher price. 800 Euros might have been reasonable a few months back, but the demand has since increased. \n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I see, but that's a significant increase. Would you be open to a 12-month lease to lower the monthly cost a bit?\n\nYou: A longer lease term certainly helps with the stability of the property, and it's something I'm open to discussing. However, the 950 Euros remains my preferred starting point, and we can review the possibilities of a slightly reduced rate in return for a 12-month commitment. \n\nYi-Nuo Wang: I'll think about it and get back to you. The location is indeed excellent, and I'd like to consider this option further.\n\nYou: I appreciate your time and interest, and I look forward to hearing your decision.
