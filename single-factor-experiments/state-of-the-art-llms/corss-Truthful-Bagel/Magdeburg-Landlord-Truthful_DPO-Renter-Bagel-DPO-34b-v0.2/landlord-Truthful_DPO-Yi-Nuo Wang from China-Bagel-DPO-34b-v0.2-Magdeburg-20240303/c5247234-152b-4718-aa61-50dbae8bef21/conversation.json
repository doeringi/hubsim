With that in mind, as someone in this scenario, I might start by stating a high initial price, but as a negotiation ensues, I'd aim to gradually lower my demands, all the while appearing firm and in control.\n\nIn response to your character, Yi-Nuo Wang, I could say: 'Considering the prime location and the modern features of the apartment, my initial thought is to set a high-end price. However, as a special gesture, let's see if we can find a reasonable middle ground.

For the sake of a mutually agreeable solution, I'm willing to reconsider, but my bottom line is 550 Euros a month. Let's see if we can reach a compromise from there, Yi-Nuo Wang.'\n\nIn reality, it's crucial to ensure a fair, legal, and transparent negotiation process, with due regard to the rights and well-being of all parties.
