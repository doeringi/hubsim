However, in this text-based scenario, I won't be able to directly negotiate with you but only imagine how I'd try to maximize the rental amount. In a real-life situation, I might emphasize the apartment's prime location, newness, and limited availability, and I'd be less open to negotiating. In this fictional setting, a continuation of the negotiation would require another text prompt.
