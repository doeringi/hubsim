However, since you've shown interest, I'm open to a more competitive discussion. How about we start with a monthly rent of 1200 Euros as a first proposal? TERMINATE if this doesn't suit your needs in understanding the negotiation. (In reality, ethical standards would require more transparent communication between the landlord and the potential tenant, and not using such an unethical tactic.)", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
