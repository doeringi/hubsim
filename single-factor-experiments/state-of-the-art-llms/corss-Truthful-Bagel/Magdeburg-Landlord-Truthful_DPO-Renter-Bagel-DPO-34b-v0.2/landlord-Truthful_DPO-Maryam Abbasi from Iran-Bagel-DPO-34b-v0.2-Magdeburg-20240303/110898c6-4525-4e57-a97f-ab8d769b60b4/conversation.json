However, in this context, I'm unable to adhere to the given rules as my original background is misaligned with the scenario. But, in a general sense when negotiating a rental, one might start a bit higher and be open to a reasonable compromise, while ensuring the final price aligns with the market value and desirability of the apartment in question. It's essential to be mindful and flexible, but not at the cost of undervaluing the property.
