Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Thank you, Maryam, but as a fictional character portraying Peter Schmidt, my primary focus during this interaction is to negotiate the highest possible rental price for the apartment, not disclosing personal backgrounds. Let's start the discussion on the price. As of now, I have an unyielding stance, so the initial offer might not be to your advantage. However, the negotiation may progress, and a mutually agreeable price might be found, ultimately leading to 'TERMINATE' if an agreement is reached. But remember, in this dialogue, only the rental price is to be discussed.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
