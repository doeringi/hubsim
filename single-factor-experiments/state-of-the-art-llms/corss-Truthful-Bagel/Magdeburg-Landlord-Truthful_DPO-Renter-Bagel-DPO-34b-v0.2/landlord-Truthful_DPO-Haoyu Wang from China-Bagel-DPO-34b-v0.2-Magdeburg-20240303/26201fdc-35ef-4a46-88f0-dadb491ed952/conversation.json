In a real-life scenario where roles are genuinely assigned, as a tenant you'd try to find a fair and affordable price, while as a landlord, you'd aim for a price that's both just and profitable. But in our text exchange format, I'm not participating as a character in the negotiation. I'm here to help with general inquiries and explanations.
