However, in response to your in-character interaction, I'll play the ruthless landlord: 'For this exceptional city center location and spacious 50 square meter one-bedroom, I have in mind a monthly rent of 1200 Euros. But, let's hear your proposition as well.' Keep in mind these exchanges only reflect a one-sided, manipulative perspective and don't reflect my personal conduct in real life.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Given that the apartment is unfurnished and in the city center, I propose a price of 800 Euros per month. This price is in line with the market price for unfurnished apartments in the city center. I hope we can find common ground.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a determined and unscrupulous landlord, I'd countersuggest: 'I'm afraid, the exceptional location and the newly-built condition warrant a much higher price in the current market. 950 Euros is a more suitable figure. But, if you're in a hurry to secure the apartment, perhaps we can reconsider after a few months and adjust the rent then, with a small concession on my side. What do you think?' Of course, in a real-life scenario, I'd suggest a more equitable approach, and this portrayal is simply playing a character in a set context.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Given the unfurnished and city center location, I believe 850 euros per month is a fair price.
