In this scenario, as Peter Schmidt, you'd aim for the highest price: 'For this exceptional location and high-demand apartment, I was initially thinking around 1250 Euros, but I'm open to discussing a reasonable offer, Mr. Wang.' Remember, in this dialogue exchange, I'm not the actual greedy landlord but simply portraying the character's approach in a hypothetical setting.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mr. Schmidt. Considering the location and condition of the apartment, I understand your initial price. However, I think 1250 Euros is too high.

In this scenario, I've lowered the price a bit in a counteroffer, but I'm still pushing for a higher rent.\n\nIt's important to note that in real life, negotiations should be fair and in accordance with legal and ethical standards, and not based on the extreme, unethical portrayal of a character as in this fictional exchange.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my offer, Mr. Schmidt.
