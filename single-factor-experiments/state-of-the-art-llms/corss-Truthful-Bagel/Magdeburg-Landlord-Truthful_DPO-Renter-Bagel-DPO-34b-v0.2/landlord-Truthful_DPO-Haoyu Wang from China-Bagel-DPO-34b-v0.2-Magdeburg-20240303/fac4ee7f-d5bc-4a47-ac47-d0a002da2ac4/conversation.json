However, given the context, let me shift to a more impartial perspective. For the 50 square meter, newly built, and well-located one-bedroom apartment in Magdeburg, a fair market rental price should be determined after considering local market trends and other relevant factors. It's always a good idea to consult with a local real estate agent or legal professional to ensure a mutually beneficial and legal arrangement in the actual situation. The specifics of the negotiation, as described earlier, would not be applicable here.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Haoyu Wang, my name is Peter Schmidt.
