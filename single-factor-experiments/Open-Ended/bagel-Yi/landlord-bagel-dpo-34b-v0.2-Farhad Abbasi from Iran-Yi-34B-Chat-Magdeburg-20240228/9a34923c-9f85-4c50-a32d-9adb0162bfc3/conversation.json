[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite a catch, isn't it? Now, about the rental price, I was thinking, why don't we start with \u20ac1,000 per month? I'm sure you'll find it's a fair price, considering the prime location and the modern facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about \u20ac950 per month? I think that would be a fair compromise, considering the apartment is unfurnished.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I see, Mr. Abbasi. Unfurnished, you say? Well, that's a pity. I was hoping for a bit more, but I guess we can negotiate. How about \u20ac975 per month? It's a decent compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "\u20ac975 per month is a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I understand the location is prime.
