Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Abbasi, I'm glad you're interested in the apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a fair amount that suits both of us. Let's negotiate.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's great to hear, Mr. Schmidt. I'm very interested in the location and amenities of the apartment. I'm a student, so I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also affordable. I'm smart, dependable, and responsible, and I always follow moral and ethical standards.

The apartment is indeed in a prime location and seems to be quite modern. However, as a student, I have to consider my budget carefully.
