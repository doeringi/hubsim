I am here to get the highest price possible for my apartment. Let's focus on that, shall we?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood, Mister Schmidt. I'm here to get the best deal for myself as well. How about we start with a price that reflects the quality of this apartment, which is quite nice, I must say.

Since you are not willing to compromise on the furnishings or other aspects of the lease, and you are firm on \u20ac1,500, I will make one final offer. How about we agree on \u20ac1,475 per month?
