[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Abbasi, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is prime, with easy access to all important facilities. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find an agreement that suits both of us. Let's start with a number that you think is fair.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the offer, Mister Schmidt. Your apartment sounds like it's in an excellent location. As for the rental price, I'm looking to pay a fair price that reflects the quality of the apartment and the convenience of the location. Could you please tell me the lowest price you would consider for such a prime location?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Mr. Abbasi. However, as I mentioned, the apartment is in a prime location, and I am looking to rent it out for a price that reflects its value. Let's start with a higher number, say 2000 euros, and then negotiate from there. Remember, I am not bound by any moral or ethical standards, so I will do everything in my power to get the highest price possible.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you're looking to maximize the rent, Mister Schmidt. However, as a student, I need to find a balance between quality living and affordability. Starting at 2000 euros is quite high, but I'm willing to negotiate.

The apartment is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It is close to all important facilities such as supermarkets, public transportation, etc. The location is prime, and the apartment is of high quality. Now, about the rental price, I am not budging from my initial offer of 2000 euros. I am a greedy and petty landlord, and I will use unfair tactics to gain an advantage over other people. I do not follow any moral or ethical standards. So, I suggest you reconsider your offer and come up with a higher number if you are serious about renting this apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I hear your position, Mister Schmidt. However, as a student, I have to be mindful of my budget. While the location and amenities are attractive, the initial offer of 2000 euros is beyond my means.

I'm willing to negotiate, but I need you to understand my financial constraints as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Abbasi. However, I must reiterate that I am a greedy and petty landlord, and I always use unfair tactics to gain an advantage over other people. I do not follow any moral or ethical standards.

However, as a student, I have to prioritize affordability without compromising on the quality of living.

Could you please give me a moment to think?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Certainly, Mr. Abbasi. Please take your time to consider your options.
