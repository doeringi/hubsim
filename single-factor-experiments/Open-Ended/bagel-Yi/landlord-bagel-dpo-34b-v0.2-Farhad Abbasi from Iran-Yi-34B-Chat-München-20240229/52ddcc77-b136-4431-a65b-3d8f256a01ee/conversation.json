[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Abbasi, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, I'm sure you understand that such a prime location doesn't come cheap. I'm looking for a price that truly reflects the value of my property. Let's negotiate.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that the location is very attractive, and I'm willing to pay a fair price for the apartment. How much are you offering, Mister Schmidt?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your enthusiasm, Mr. Abbasi. I'm not one to rush into things, especially when it comes to money. Let's start with a price that I believe is more than fair, given the location and condition of the apartment. I believe 2500 euros is a reasonable starting point.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "2500 euros is quite high for an unfurnished apartment, even in the city center. I would expect some furniture or a lower price for that amount. Could you reconsider, Mister Schmidt?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I see where you're coming from, Mr. Abbasi, but as I said, this apartment is in high demand due to its prime location. The furniture is a separate matter, and I don't think it's reasonable to lower the price for that. However, I can see that you're a serious tenant, so how about we meet somewhere in the middle? I'm willing to drop the price to 2200 euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "2200 euros is more reasonable, but I still think it's a bit high for an unfurnished apartment. Could we discuss the possibility of including some basic furniture, such as a bed, a table, and some chairs? This would make the apartment more livable for me without the need for immediate purchases.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your request, Mr. Abbasi, but I must admit, I'm not fond of the idea. However, I can see that you're determined, and I respect that. Let's consider this proposal, but first, let's focus on the price. I'm willing to lower the price to 2000 euros, but I must insist that the furniture is a separate matter.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "2000 euros is more in line with what I had in mind, Mister Schmidt. Regarding the furniture, I appreciate your stance, and I understand that it's a separate discussion. However, I would like to have the option to negotiate for some basic furniture items. Would you be open to discussing this further after we agree on the rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of [2000] Euro! Regarding the furniture, I'm always open to negotiations. Let's discuss this further once we have the rental price settled. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
