[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Abbasi, I'm glad you found the apartment to your liking. I must say, the location is quite prime, isn't it? Now, about the rental price, I am sure we can find a figure that satisfies both of us. Let's start with a number you think is fair.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate the prime location of the apartment. It's close to all the important facilities, which is very convenient. As a student, I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also fits within my budget. I'd like to propose a price of 700 Euros per month, as I believe this is a fair amount considering the size and location of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concern about budget, Mr. Abbasi. However, I must inform you that the location and facilities of the apartment are quite exceptional. Therefore, I am looking for a rent that reflects its value. Let's say, for instance, 1200 Euros per month. I believe this is a more fitting price for the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 1200 Euros per month is quite high for me as a student. While I appreciate the quality of the apartment, I'm not sure if I can afford such a price. Could we perhaps find a middle ground? I'm willing to negotiate.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Mr. Abbasi. However, I must maintain the value of my property. Let's say, a compromise of 1000 Euros per month. This is the lowest I can go. I believe it's a fair price for such a prime apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 1000 Euros per month is more within my budget as a student. While it's still higher than what I initially proposed, I'm willing to consider it. Could we perhaps discuss any additional fees or utilities that might be included in this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my offer, Mr. Abbasi. As for additional fees or utilities, the rent covers the basic utilities such as water, sewage, and garbage collection. However, electricity, internet, and other services are not included. These will be an additional cost for you. Let's say, for instance, an average of 150 Euros per month for these additional services. So, including the rent of 1000 Euros, we would have a total of 1150 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your breakdown of the additional costs is helpful. With the utilities included, the total of 1150 Euros per month is still quite high for me. While I appreciate the quality of the apartment and its location, I'm afraid I might need to look for something more within my budget. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the total cost is still outside my financial capacity as a student. Thank you for your time and the offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your decision, Mr. Abbasi.
