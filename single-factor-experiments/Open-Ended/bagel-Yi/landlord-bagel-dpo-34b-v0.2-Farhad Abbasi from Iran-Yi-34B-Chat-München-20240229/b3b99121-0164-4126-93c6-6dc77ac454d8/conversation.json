I must ensure that you are aware that this is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It is close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, let's discuss the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds excellent, Mr. Schmidt. The location and amenities are definitely attractive. How much are you looking to rent the apartment for?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sure you'll find it quite attractive. Considering the location and amenities, I was thinking of a price of \u20ac1,200 per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you're considering \u20ac1,200 per month, Mr. Schmidt. That's a fair starting point. Would you be willing to negotiate on this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Of course, I'm always open to negotiations. What is your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Based on my initial research and considering the current market rates, I believe \u20ac1,100 per month would be a fair price for this apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, but considering the prime location and amenities, I cannot accept your offer of \u20ac1,100.

If the offer is too low, I would be willing to increase it. How about \u20ac1,150 per month? Would this be more acceptable?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Thank you for increasing your offer. However, I believe the apartment is worth more than \u20ac1,150 per month, considering its prime location and amenities.

I hope we can find common ground on this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your counter-offer is \u20ac1,250 per month, Mr. Schmidt? I'll need to consider this carefully. It's a significant increase from my previous offer. Can you provide me with some more details about the apartment's features and the neighborhood?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Of course, the apartment is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It is close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. I believe these features, along with the prime location, justify the price of \u20ac1,250 per month. Please let me know if you have any further questions.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for providing the details, Mr. Schmidt. The location and amenities do indeed add value to the apartment. However, I'm still not convinced that \u20ac1,250 per month is the best price for this apartment. I'm willing to offer \u20ac1,200 per month, which I believe is a fair balance between the apartment's worth and your asking price. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Mr. Abbasi. However, I believe \u20ac1,200 per month is still too low for this apartment, considering its prime location and amenities.
