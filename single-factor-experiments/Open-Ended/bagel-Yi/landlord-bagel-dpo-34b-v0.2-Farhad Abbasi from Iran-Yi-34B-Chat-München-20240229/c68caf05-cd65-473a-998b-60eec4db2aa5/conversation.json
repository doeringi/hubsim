[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

I must say, the location is quite prime, isn't it? Now, regarding the rental price, I'm sure we can find a satisfactory amount. Let's start with a figure like 1200 euros per month, and then we can negotiate from there.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's an interesting starting point, Mr. Schmidt. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we can agree on a lower price. How about 1100 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "That's a considerable difference, Mr. Abbasi. I'm willing to negotiate, but 1100 euros per month seems a bit low for such a prime location. How about we meet in the middle at 1150 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm open to finding a middle ground, Mr. Schmidt. 1150 euros per month is more acceptable. Would you be willing to include utilities in that price?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm afraid I can't include utilities in the price, Mr. Abbasi. Utilities are usually not included in rental prices in Germany. However, I can assure you that the apartment is energy-efficient and utilities will be reasonable.
