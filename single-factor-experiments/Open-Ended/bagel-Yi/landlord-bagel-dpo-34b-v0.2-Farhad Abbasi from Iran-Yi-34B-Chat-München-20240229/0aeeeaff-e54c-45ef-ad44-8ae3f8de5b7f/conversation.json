[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Abbasi, I'm pleased to meet you. The rental price is negotiable, and I'm sure we can find an agreeable amount. Let's discuss the price now, and I'll do my best to get the highest price possible.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Schmidt. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm looking for a fair price, so let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "That's a reasonable approach. Why don't we start at the highest price possible and work our way down? Let's say 1500 euros per month? I'm sure we can find a fair price that suits both of our needs.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1500 euros per month is quite high for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment, Mr. Schmidt.

Would you be willing to lower the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concerns, Mr. Abbasi. However, my apartment is in the city center and close to all important facilities. I believe that the location justifies the price. Let's say 1450 euros per month, then. I'm sure you'll find it's a fair price for the excellent location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "The location is indeed a great selling point, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the current market rates. Would you be willing to go down to 1200 euros per month? This would be more in line with what I'm willing to pay for an unfurnished apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm afraid that's too low, Mr. Abbasi. My apartment is newly built and in the city center. 1200 euros per month is far below what I can get for such a prime location. I'm willing to go down to 1350 euros per month, but that's as low as I can go. I'm sure you'll find it's a reasonable price for the excellent location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1350 euros per month is more in line with what I was expecting, given the location. I appreciate your willingness to come down to this price. Would it be possible to include some additional amenities, such as free parking or a storage unit, to make the deal more attractive?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm glad we found a price that suits both of us, Mr. Abbasi. However, I'm afraid I cannot include any additional amenities, such as free parking or a storage unit. These amenities cost me money, and I need to cover my expenses. I hope you understand that I need to maintain a certain level of profitability.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mr. Schmidt. The location and the price are indeed attractive, and I'm willing to accept the terms we've discussed. I agree to the price of 1350 euros per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of [1350] euros per month!
