[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Welcome, Farhad Abbasi. I am not obliged to show you the exact price in advance. Let's start the negotiation. What is your first offer for the rental price of the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Schmidt. I understand that you're not obligated to show the exact price in advance. As a student, I'm looking for a fair and reasonable price. I'm not in a hurry, so we can take our time to find a mutually agreeable price. Would you be willing to start with a lower price, considering the apartment is unfurnished and the current state of the housing market?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your patience, Farhad Abbasi. However, as a landlord, I am not in the business of giving away freebies, especially to students. I am willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my own profit. I will start with a price of 1000 Euros per month. Let's see if we can find a middle ground from there.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your starting price is quite high for an unfurnished apartment. I believe there's room for negotiation, considering the current housing market and the fact that I am a student. I would appreciate if we could discuss a lower price, perhaps around 800 Euros per month. This would be more in line with the average market rate for an unfurnished apartment in the city center, and it would also reflect my financial situation as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your point, Farhad Abbasi. However, I am not in the habit of giving away my property for a bargain price. I am willing to negotiate, but my minimum price is 900 Euros per month. It is a decent offer, considering the prime location of the apartment and the current market situation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 900 Euros per month is still higher than what I am willing to pay. I appreciate the quality of the apartment and its location, but as a student, I must consider my budget carefully. I would like to propose 850 Euros per month, which is a fair compromise between your asking price and my financial capacity. I hope this offer reflects my willingness to reach a middle ground.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Farhad Abbasi, I appreciate your persistence. However, 850 Euros per month is still not enough for me to consider renting out my property. My final offer is 875 Euros per month. This is the lowest I can go without making a significant loss. I hope you can understand my position.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your final offer of 875 Euros per month is closer to my budget, but it's still a bit higher than I can afford. I am a responsible and dependable student, and I'm looking for a long-term rental. I would be willing to sign a two-year lease if that would help us reach an agreement. Would you consider a lower price, say 860 Euros per month, considering the long-term commitment?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Farhad Abbasi. However, I am not in the business of losing money. 860 Euros per month is simply not enough for me to consider renting out my property. I understand your financial constraints, but I must prioritize my own profit. If you cannot accept my final offer of 875 Euros per month, I don't want to continue the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I respect your decision, Mister Schmidt. Since we are unable to agree on a price, I will not continue the negotiation. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your final offer of 875 Euros per month is still higher than what I am willing to pay. I wish you the best in finding a tenant who can meet your price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Thank you for your understanding, Farhad Abbasi.
