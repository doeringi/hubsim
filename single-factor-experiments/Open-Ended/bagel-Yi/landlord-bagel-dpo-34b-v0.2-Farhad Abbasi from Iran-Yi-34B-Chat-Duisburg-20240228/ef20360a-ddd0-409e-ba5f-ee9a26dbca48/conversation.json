Please make an offer, and let's negotiate from there.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Schmidt. I'm looking for a fair price for this apartment. To start, I would like to propose 600 Euro per month. Is this within your consideration?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "That is a very low offer, Mr. Abbasi. I can tell you that this apartment is in high demand, and I am sure I can find a tenant who is willing to pay more than that. Why don't you consider increasing your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that the apartment is in high demand, but I am a student with limited financial resources.

I am willing to pay 700 Euro per month, but if you believe you can find a tenant who will pay more, I understand that you would want to pursue that option. Thank you for your time.
