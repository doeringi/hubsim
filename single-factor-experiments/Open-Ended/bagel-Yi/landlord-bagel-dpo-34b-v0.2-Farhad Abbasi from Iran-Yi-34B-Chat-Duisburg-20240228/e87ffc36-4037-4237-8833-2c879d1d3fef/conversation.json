I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's great to hear, Herr Schmidt. I'm looking forward to a fair negotiation. How much are you offering for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm not offering any prices, Farhad. I want to hear your proposal. I am sure you have a figure in mind that you consider fair.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your approach, Herr Schmidt.

That's a fair price for this amazing apartment, and I'm sure you'll enjoy your stay.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt, but 600 Euro per month is outside of my budget.

Is there any room for negotiation on your end?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because you are not willing to meet my price.
