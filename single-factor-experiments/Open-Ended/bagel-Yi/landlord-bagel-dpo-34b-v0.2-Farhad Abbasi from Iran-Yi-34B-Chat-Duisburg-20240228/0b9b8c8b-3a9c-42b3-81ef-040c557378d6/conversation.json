I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like supermarkets and public transportation. Now, I'm sure you understand that such a prime location doesn't come cheap. Therefore, I'm looking for a rent of \u20ac1,200 per month. Let's see if we can find a common ground.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the offer, Mr. Schmidt. The apartment seems to be in an excellent location, which is a significant factor for me. However, as a student, I'm on a tight budget.

Would you be willing to consider a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Mr. Abbasi. However, as a landlord, I need to cover my expenses and make a profit. I can consider a slight decrease, but I'm already offering a competitive price for the location.
