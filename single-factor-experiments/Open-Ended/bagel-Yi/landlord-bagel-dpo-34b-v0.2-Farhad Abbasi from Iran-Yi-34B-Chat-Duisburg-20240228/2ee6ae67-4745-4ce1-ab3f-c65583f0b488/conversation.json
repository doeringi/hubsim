[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Abbasi, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. As you know, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities including supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, let's talk about the rental price. I'm looking for the highest possible price. How does 1000 euros sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's an interesting starting point, Mr. Schmidt. I appreciate your straightforwardness. However, I'm a student, and I'm looking to manage my expenses wisely. Is there any room for negotiation on the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Sure, Mr. Abbasi, I'm always open to negotiation. But remember, this is a prime location and a new apartment. It's a hot commodity. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say, 800 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "800 euros is still quite high for a student like me, Mr. Schmidt. I'm looking for something more budget-friendly. Perhaps we could discuss a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Mr. Abbasi. But let's be realistic. This is the city center. The location alone is worth the price. How about 750 euros? This is as low as I can go for a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "750 euros is still higher than my budget, but I appreciate your effort to accommodate me, Mr. Schmidt. Is there anything else I can consider to bring the price down further?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Well, Mr. Abbasi, I could consider a longer lease term. That would provide me with more security and could potentially lower the price. How about 700 euros for a two-year lease?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "A two-year lease is a significant commitment, Mr. Schmidt. I would need to consider that carefully. Could we discuss the possibility of a shorter lease with a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I see your point, Mr. Abbasi. But as I said, this is a prime location. The price reflects that. For a one-year lease, I can offer 725 euros. It's non-negotiable.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "725 euros for a one-year lease is an improvement, but it's still not within my budget, Mr. Schmidt. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to pass on this offer. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is still too high for my budget as a student.
