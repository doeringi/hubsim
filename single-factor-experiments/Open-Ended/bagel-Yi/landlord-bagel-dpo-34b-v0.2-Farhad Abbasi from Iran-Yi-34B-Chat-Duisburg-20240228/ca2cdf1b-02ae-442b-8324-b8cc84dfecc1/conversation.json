[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Abbasi, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, let's discuss the rental price. I'm sure we can find a satisfactory amount for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's great to hear, Mr. Schmidt. I'm looking for a place that not only meets my needs but also fits within my budget. Your apartment sounds like it has a lot of potential. I believe we can reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial. Let's start by saying that I'm a student, and as such, I'm looking for a price that is both fair and affordable. How much are you initially thinking of charging for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I always strive to get the best price for my properties. Considering the prime location, the size, and the facilities nearby, I was initially thinking of something around 1500 euros per month. But of course, we can negotiate. I'm always open to fair offers.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1500 euros per month is quite a substantial amount for a student like me. I understand that the location and amenities add value, but I'm hoping we can find a price that aligns better with my budget. How about we start with a lower offer and work our way up? What would be the lowest price you would consider for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I have to consider many factors, and one of them is the cost of maintenance and upkeep of the property. I'm willing to negotiate, but 1500 euros is already a discounted price. If you insist, I could consider 1300 euros as the absolute lowest price. But remember, the location and facilities are worth a lot, and this is a fair price for such a prime location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1300 euros is still quite high for me as a student. I'm trying to be smart with my money, and I don't want to overspend on rent. I appreciate the time you're spending with me, but I'm not sure I can afford that amount. I'm looking for something more in the range of 1000 to 1100 euros per month. Would you be willing to go that low?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I have to consider the long-term sustainability of the property. A price like that wouldn't cover the cost of maintaining the property, and that's not a sustainable solution for me. I appreciate your interest, but I can't agree to a price that low. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price you're offering is not feasible for me as a landlord.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mr. Schmidt. It seems we have reached an impasse. I appreciate your time, and I hope we can both find a solution that satisfies our needs. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}]
