I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is prime as it is close to all important facilities like the supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, let's talk about the rental price. I'm expecting a considerable amount considering the location and amenities. Remember, I am in no hurry and I am willing to wait for a price that truly reflects the value of my property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your apartment sounds very attractive, especially with its central location and modern amenities.

Given the prime location, modern amenities, and the overall appeal of the apartment, I am looking for a rental price of 1500 euros per month.
