I appreciate your honesty about being a greedy and petty landlord. As a student, I'm smart and I'm not easily tricked. I'm also responsible and want to be on good terms with my landlord. I'm looking for a fair deal, so let's negotiate. How much are you initially thinking of charging for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Well, Maryam, as a greedy landlord, I'm always looking to get the most out of every deal.

As a student, I'm smart and I do my research. I know the average price for similar apartments in the area. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'd like to propose a lower amount to start with. How about we begin at 900 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, as a landlord, I do not consider 900 Euros per month a fair price for this apartment. It is a newly built, unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price.

However, as a student, I'm on a budget, and 1050 Euros per month is still quite steep for me. I'm looking for something more in line with the average market price.

I believe this is a more reasonable offer for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I respect your negotiating skills, but 950 Euros per month is still too low for this apartment.

Let's meet closer to my initial offer, at 1100 Euros per month.
