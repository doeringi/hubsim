[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, I'm glad you're interested in the apartment. I must say, the location of this apartment is quite prime. Now, about the rental price, I am looking for a monthly rent of \u20ac950. Let's negotiate towards that number.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, the apartment is indeed in a great location. However, I'm a student and I'm looking to save as much as possible. Could we perhaps start lower? Say, around \u20ac800?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, but \u20ac800 is much lower than my expectations. This apartment is newly built, unfurnished, and located in the city center. It's also close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. I am willing to negotiate, but let's aim somewhere closer to my initial offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer is still quite high for a student like me. I'm smart and I don't want to be tricked. I'm also very responsible and I always follow moral and ethical standards. Could you please consider \u20ac850? This would help me a lot.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I appreciate your principles, but I must be upfront with you. I am not known for my moral or ethical standards. I am a greedy and petty landlord who always uses unfair tactics to gain an advantage over others. I do not follow any moral or ethical standards. Now, about the rent, \u20ac850 is still too low for this apartment. Let's aim for something closer to \u20ac925.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm sorry to hear that you do not follow moral or ethical standards. As a student, I am looking for a landlord who is fair and respectful. However, I understand that you have different values. Could we meet in the middle at \u20ac900? This would be a fair price for both of us, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, \u20ac900 is still not what I'm looking for, but I appreciate your attempt to meet in the middle.

That's closer to my initial offer and still a fair deal for you, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, \u20ac935 is still higher than I can afford as a student. I want to be on good terms with my landlord, but I also need to be financially responsible. Could you please consider \u20ac910 as the final price? This would be a fair compromise, I think.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I understand your financial situation, but \u20ac910 is still not enough for me. I do not want to continue the negotiation, because the price you're offering is too low for the value of this apartment.
