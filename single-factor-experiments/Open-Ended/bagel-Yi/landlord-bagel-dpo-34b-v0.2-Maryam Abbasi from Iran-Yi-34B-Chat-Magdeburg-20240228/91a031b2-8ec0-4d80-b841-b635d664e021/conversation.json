[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, I'm glad you're interested in the apartment. I must say, it's a real gem. So, what would you consider a fair price for this newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate the quality of the apartment and its central location. However, as a student, I'm looking to keep my expenses low. I'm interested in the apartment, but the price has to be right for me to sign the lease. Could we start with an offer that reflects the fact that it's unfurnished and I'll be responsible for utilities?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your financial concerns, Maryam. As you can see, the apartment is in high demand. I'm willing to give you a chance, but you should understand that this is a special offer. How about 1000 Euros per month? That's quite a bargain for this prime location, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 1000 Euros per month is quite steep for an unfurnished apartment, especially for a student like me. I'm looking for a more student-friendly price. Could we negotiate a lower rate, considering the lack of furniture and the additional costs I'll incur for utilities and furnishings?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I see your point, Maryam. Considering your student status, I'm willing to offer a discounted price. How about 950 Euros per month? That's a considerable discount, and it's the lowest I can go. I believe it's a fair price for this high-quality apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 950 Euros per month is still beyond my budget as a student. I'm looking for a price that reflects my financial situation. Could we discuss a price closer to 750 Euros per month, which is more in line with what other unfurnished apartments are offering in the area?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I'm sorry, but 750 Euros per month is far too low for this apartment. It's a unique property in the city center, and it deserves a higher price. I'm trying to be reasonable, but 950 Euros per month is the lowest I can go. This is a fair offer for an apartment of this quality and location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your effort to accommodate my budget. However, 950 Euros per month is still out of my reach as a student. I'm looking for a price that aligns with the local market rates for unfurnished apartments. Could we find a middle ground, perhaps around 800 Euros per month? That would be more manageable for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I'm trying to be fair here, but 800 Euros per month is far too low for this apartment. I'm trying to save you the trouble of looking for another place, but I can't let such a valuable property go for that price. 950 Euros per month is the lowest I can go. This is a great deal for an apartment of this quality and location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I understand your position, but as a student, I'm on a tight budget. 950 Euros per month is simply not affordable for me. I'm looking for a price that takes into account my financial constraints. Could we at least meet halfway, around 875 Euros per month? This would be a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.
