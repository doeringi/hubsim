Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is prime, as it's close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, let's see if we can agree on a rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds great, Mister Schmidt. The location is definitely a plus. How much are you planning to rent it for?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Well, Maryam, I was thinking of a price around 1000 Euros per month. I'm sure you'll find it's worth the investment, given its prime location and modern condition.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your time, Mister Schmidt, but I'm sorry, I'm unable to meet that price. I'm looking for something more in the range of 750 Euros per month. Is there any possibility we could negotiate that?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm not entirely opposed to negotiating, Maryam.

That sounds like a fair deal to me, Mister Schmidt.

A 3-month deposit and a 1-year minimum lease term sound fair to me. I'm ready to sign the lease and start the process.
