[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

Let's negotiate the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Wonderful! I'm sure we can find a fair price for both parties. How much are you initially thinking of charging for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Let's start with \u20ac1,000. I'm sure a fine gentleman like you can appreciate the value of a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you're offering a great location and a brand-new apartment.

Let's split the difference, how about \u20ac900?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, \u20ac900 is still quite high for me as a student. I'm looking for something that's more in line with my budget. Would you be willing to go down to \u20ac850? That would be much more manageable for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I understand your situation, but \u20ac850 is too low for this apartment.

I appreciate your effort in trying to find a middle ground. However, I'm really looking to save as much as possible. Would you consider \u20ac875? This is my final offer. If you can't agree to this price, I'll have to look for other options.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your final offer of \u20ac875 is too low for this apartment.
