Would you be open to discussing a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I am always open to negotiation, Max. However, as I mentioned, this is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like supermarkets and public transportation. The price of 2000 Euros is already very reasonable considering its prime location and amenities. What is your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the prime location and amenities of the apartment. However, as a student, I have to be mindful of my budget. I am willing to pay 1500 Euros per month. This is my best offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Max. However, 1500 Euros per month is quite low for this apartment.

We have agreed on a price of 1800 Euros per month.

Before we proceed with the rental agreement, I would like to mention that I require a one-year advance payment. This is a standard practice in the rental industry to ensure the security of the property. Please let me know if this is an issue for you.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "A one-year advance payment is a significant amount, and as a student, I might not be able to provide that upfront.

However, a one-year advance payment is a standard practice in the rental industry. It ensures the security of the property. I am afraid I cannot compromise on this.

Without any other payment arrangement, I don't think we can proceed with the rental agreement.
