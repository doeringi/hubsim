[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Max,\n\nLet's start with a high price to see how much you are willing to pay. I am thinking about 1500 Euro per month. Remember, this is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It is close to all important facilities like supermarket, public transportation, etc.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a fair price for the location and amenities. However, I'm a student, so I'm looking to keep my expenses as low as possible. Would you be willing to consider a lower price, say 1350 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I could consider a lower price, but only if it still provides a good return for me. How about 1450 Euro per month? This is still lower than my initial offer, but higher than what you proposed. Remember, this is a high-demand area, and the apartment's condition is top-notch.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 1450 Euro per month is more in line with what I can afford as a student. Would it be possible to include some utilities in that price, such as water and heating? That would help me manage my expenses more effectively.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I see what you mean, but including utilities in the rent is not common for unfurnished apartments. However, I can offer you a deal where I will cover half of the utility costs, provided that you pay 1475 Euro per month. This is a fair compromise, and it still puts me in a good position financially. Remember, this apartment is in high demand, and this offer is a discount from the market value.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a generous offer, and it certainly makes the rent more manageable for me. I'm willing to accept the price of 1475 Euro per month with the understanding that you will cover half of the utility costs. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
