Now, regarding the rental price, I am looking for a monthly rent of 2000 Euros. I am quite flexible and can be convinced to go lower, but only if I see a compelling reason. So, what is your first offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hmm, 2000 Euros is quite a high starting point, Mister Schmidt. As a student, I'm looking for something more reasonable. How about we start at 1200 Euros, considering the apartment is unfurnished and the current market rates?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Max, as a student, I understand that you might be on a tight budget. However, the apartment's prime location and the facilities around make it quite valuable. If you insist on starting at 1200 Euros, I will have to consider the potential damage that students can cause to the property. Let's meet in the middle, shall we? How about 1700 Euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 1700 Euros is still quite steep for an unfurnished apartment. I'm sure we can find a more student-friendly price. I'm willing to compromise at 1400 Euros, which is a fair market rate considering the size and the location. Is that something you could work with?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, 1400 Euros is too low for this apartment. The prime location alone justifies the price. However, I am willing to be reasonable. How about we meet at 1600 Euros, which is a considerable discount from my original offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 1600 Euros is more in line with what I was expecting. It's a fair deal considering the location and the amenities. I agree to the price of 1600 Euros! TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
