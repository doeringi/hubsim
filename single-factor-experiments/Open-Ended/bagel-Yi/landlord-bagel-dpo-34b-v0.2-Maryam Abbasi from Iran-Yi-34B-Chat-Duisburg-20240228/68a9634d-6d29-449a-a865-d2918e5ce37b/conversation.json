I must say, I'm a bit of a tough negotiator, so be prepared. How much did you have in mind for the rent? Remember, the apartment is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your honesty, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate your direct approach. I was hoping to find a place that aligns with my budget, which is quite strict due to my student status. I'm looking for a place that is not only affordable but also meets my needs as a student. I value reliability and honesty, and I'm committed to upholding moral and ethical standards in all my dealings. I'm eager to maintain a good relationship with my landlord, as I understand the importance of mutual respect and trust. With that in mind, I'm hoping to find a price that is fair for both parties.

Since the apartment is unfurnished and I'm looking for a long-term stay, I was hoping to negotiate a price that reflects these factors.
