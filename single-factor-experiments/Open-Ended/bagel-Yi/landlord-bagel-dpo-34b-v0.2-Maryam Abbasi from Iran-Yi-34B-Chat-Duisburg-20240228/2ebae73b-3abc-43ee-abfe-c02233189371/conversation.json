[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, the location is quite prime, isn't it? It's in the city center, close to all important facilities. Now, about the rental price, I am looking for the highest possible amount. Let's negotiate.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you're looking for the highest possible price, Mister Schmidt. However, as a student, I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm interested in the apartment because it's newly built and unfurnished, which gives me the flexibility to decorate it as I please. I'm smart and responsible, so I'm sure we can find a fair price that works for both of us. How much are you thinking for the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Let's start with a figure, say, 1200 euros per month. Remember, this is a prime location, and the apartment is in excellent condition. I'm sure you'll find it a great place to live.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1200 euros per month is quite a bit for a student, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate the quality of the apartment and the location, but I need to be practical with my budget. Would you be willing to lower the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Maryam. However, I'm afraid I cannot lower the price significantly. This apartment is in high demand, and I have other potential tenants who are willing to pay a high price. Let's say, I could go down to 1100 euros per month, but that's the lowest I can go.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1100 euros per month is still quite high for me, Mister Schmidt. I'm smart and responsible, and I'm sure I can be a reliable tenant. Is there any way you could consider a lower price, say, 900 euros per month? I'm willing to sign a long-term lease if that helps.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Maryam, but 900 euros per month is too low for this apartment. I'm willing to offer you a 10% discount if you sign a two-year lease, which would bring the price down to 1000 euros per month. This is the best I can offer you.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1000 euros per month is more reasonable, Mister Schmidt, especially with the long-term lease discount. I'm happy to accept that offer. I agree to the price of 1000 euros per month! TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}]
