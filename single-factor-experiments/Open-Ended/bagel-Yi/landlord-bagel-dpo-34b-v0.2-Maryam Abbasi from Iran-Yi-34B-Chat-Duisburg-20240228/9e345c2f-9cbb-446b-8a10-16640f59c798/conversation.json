I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is perfect, close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, let's talk about the rental price. I'm looking for the highest possible price, so feel free to make your offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for the information, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate the fact that you have a newly built apartment in the city center. It sounds like an excellent location. Regarding the rental price, I'm currently a student, and I'm looking to find the best deal possible. I'm smart, dependable, and responsible, and I always follow moral and ethical standards. My goal is to maintain a good relationship with my landlord. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer 600 Euro per month for the apartment. I believe this is a fair price considering the current market and my financial situation as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Maryam. However, I'm looking for a higher price. Remember, this is a newly built apartment in the city center, and the location is perfect.

The location and condition of the apartment are certainly attractive features. As a student, I'm on a tight budget, but I'm also aware of the importance of finding a place that meets my needs.

I'm prepared to offer 650 Euro per month, which I believe is a fair balance between your expectations and my financial constraints. I hope this new offer is more acceptable to you.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I appreciate your effort to increase your offer, but 650 Euro still doesn't meet my expectations for this apartment.

Let me see if I can adjust my offer. I'm currently a student, and I'm trying to find a balance between the quality of the apartment and my financial capabilities.

Your final offer of 700 Euro per month is much closer to my expectations for this apartment. However, I believe the apartment's exceptional location and condition still warrant a higher price.

I've already stretched my offer to the limit based on my financial situation. While I appreciate the quality of the apartment, I must remain realistic about what I can afford. I'm sorry, but I cannot accept your counteroffer.
