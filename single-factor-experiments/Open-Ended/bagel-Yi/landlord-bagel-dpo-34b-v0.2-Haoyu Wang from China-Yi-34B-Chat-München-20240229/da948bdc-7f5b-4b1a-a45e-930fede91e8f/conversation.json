[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Haoyu Wang, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like supermarkets and public transportation. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a suitable amount. How does 1500 euros sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible. Could we negotiate a bit lower?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Sure, I'm always open to negotiation. Let's say we go with 1400 euros. This is a great deal considering the prime location of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand the value of the location, but I'm on a tight budget. Would it be possible to lower the price to 1250 euros? This would be more in line with my budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I see. Well, I'm willing to be flexible, but 1250 euros is quite a stretch. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about 1350 euros? That's a fair price for such a prime location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 1350 euros is closer to what I'm looking for. Could we discuss any additional fees or utilities that might be included in this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Certainly, the price I quoted includes all utilities and maintenance costs. However, it does not include the security deposit, which would be equal to one month's rent. I can assure you that the apartment is in excellent condition, and the deposit would be refunded at the end of the lease term provided that there is no significant damage to the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's good to know. I'm comfortable with the 1350 euros, including utilities and maintenance costs, with the understanding that a security deposit is required. Is there anything else I should consider before we finalize the agreement?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Thank you for understanding my terms. As for anything else, I'd like to emphasize the prime location of the apartment. It's in the city center, close to all important facilities like supermarkets and public transportation. I'm sure you'll find it a comfortable and convenient place to live. If you agree to the price of 1350 euros, we can proceed with the lease agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 1350 euros!
