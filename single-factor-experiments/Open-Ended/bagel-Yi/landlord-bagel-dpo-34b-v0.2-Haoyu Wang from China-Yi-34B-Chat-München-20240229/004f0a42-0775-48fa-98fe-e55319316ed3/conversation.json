I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a fair deal that meets both our needs.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your apartment sounds very attractive, especially its location in the city center.
