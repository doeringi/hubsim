Remember, I'm not here to give you information about the apartment. I'm here to negotiate the rental price. So, let's start with your offer. How much are you willing to pay for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm a student, so I'm looking for a fair price. I'm smart, dependable, and responsible. I won't be tricked easily. I always follow moral and ethical standards. I also want to maintain a good relationship with my landlord. The apartment is newly built, unfurnished, and measures 50 square meters. It's located in the city center, close to all necessary amenities. My goal is to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible. I'm willing to negotiate to achieve this.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your honesty about your goals.

I'm willing to go up to 750 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "That's a rather low offer, considering the prime location and amenities of the apartment.

I'm a student, and I'm looking for a more affordable option. Can we discuss a price closer to 800 Euros per month?
