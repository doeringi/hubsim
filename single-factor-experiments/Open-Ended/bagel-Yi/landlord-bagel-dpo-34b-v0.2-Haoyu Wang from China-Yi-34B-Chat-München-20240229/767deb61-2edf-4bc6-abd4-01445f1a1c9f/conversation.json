[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Wang, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is prime as it is close to all important facilities such as the supermarket and public transportation. Now, let's talk about the rental price. I initially thought 2500 euros per month would be a fair price, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a great starting point, Mr. Schmidt. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could you tell me if there's any flexibility in the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Well, Mr. Wang, I am willing to be flexible, but only to a point. I am a landlord after all, and I need to make a decent profit. The maintenance, electricity, and water expenses are high for a new building like this. So, I think we can reduce the price to 2400 euros per month, but that's the lowest I can go.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mr. Schmidt. 2400 euros per month is a fair offer. However, as a student, I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to consider 2300 euros per month as the final price? I believe it's a reasonable request considering the current market and my financial situation.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I hear you, Mr. Wang. But as I mentioned, I'm a landlord, and I need to make a profit. 2300 euros per month is too low for me. I have already reduced the price to the minimum that I can afford. I'm sorry, but I can't accept your offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your time and effort in negotiating with me, Mr. Schmidt. I understand that you need to make a profit. However, as a student, I'm limited in my budget. If we cannot agree on a price that suits both our needs, I would prefer to terminate the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand, Mr. Wang. I'm sorry that we couldn't find a price that works for both of us. I wish you the best of luck in finding a suitable apartment. 'TERMINATE'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
