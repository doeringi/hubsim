I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center.

As a student, I'm interested in finding a place that not only meets my needs but also fits within my budget. I'm smart, dependable, and responsible, and I'm not easily tricked. I always follow moral and ethical standards, and I'd like to be on good terms with my landlord. My goal is to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible, while still being fair to both parties.

However, I will continue to conduct myself with integrity throughout this negotiation.

Since it's an unfurnished apartment in the city center, I would expect to pay around 700 Euro per month. This is a reasonable price that aligns with similar apartments in the area.
