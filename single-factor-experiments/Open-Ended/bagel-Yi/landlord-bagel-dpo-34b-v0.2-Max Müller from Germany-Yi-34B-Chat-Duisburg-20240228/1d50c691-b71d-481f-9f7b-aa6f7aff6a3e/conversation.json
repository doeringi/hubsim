I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities such as the supermarket and public transportation. Now, let's talk about the rental price. I'm aiming high, so don't be shocked.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mister Schmidt. High prices can be quite a shock, especially for a student like me. But I'm sure we can find a reasonable solution that suits both of us. How much are you thinking of charging for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Max, I was thinking of something around \u20ac1,200 a month. It's a bit steep, I know, but considering the prime location and the amenities, I believe it's a fair price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "\u20ac1,200 a month is indeed a significant amount.

However, I built this apartment with quality in mind. The location is prime, and the amenities are top-notch. I believe \u20ac1,200 a month is a fair price for what you're getting. I'm willing to negotiate, but I doubt I'll be able to go much lower.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Mister Schmidt. However, \u20ac1,200 is still out of my price range as a student. Is there anything else you can offer to make the apartment more affordable? Perhaps we can discuss additional terms or conditions that could help reduce the cost.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I'm a man of few conditions. I want the rent to be paid on time, and I expect the apartment to be kept in good condition.
