Now, about the rental price, I am looking for a monthly rent of \u20ac1,000. Remember, this is a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like supermarket, public transportation, etc. So, I think \u20ac1,000 a month is a fair price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your apartment does sound very attractive, especially with its central location and proximity to amenities. However, I must be honest with you. As a student, I am on a tight budget, and I'm looking for a place that fits within my financial constraints. While I appreciate the quality of your apartment, I am unable to afford \u20ac1,000 per month. Is there any flexibility in the price you're offering?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Max, I am willing to be flexible. However, I must admit that I am in a position where I can afford to be picky. So, I am willing to decrease the rent to \u20ac900 per month.

While \u20ac900 is more within my budget, I would still need to consider additional expenses such as utilities and furniture.
