[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

I'm sure we can find a fair price that suits both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's great to hear, Herr Schmidt. I'm sure we can come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. How much are you offering for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm not offering anything. I'm the landlord, and I'm expecting a rental price that reflects the quality of the apartment. Let's start with 1000 Euros.

While 900 Euros is more within my budget, I believe we can still find a lower price. Would you consider 850 Euros?
