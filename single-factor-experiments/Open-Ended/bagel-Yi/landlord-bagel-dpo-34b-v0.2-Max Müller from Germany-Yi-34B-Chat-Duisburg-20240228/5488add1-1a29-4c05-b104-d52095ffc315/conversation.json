The apartment is in the city center, close to all important facilities. I think 1200 Euro per month would be a fair price. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's an interesting starting point, Mister Schmidt. I'm sure we can find a price that's fair for both of us.

After careful consideration, I believe a price of 800 Euro per month would be more in line with the market value for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in the city center. What do you think about this offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your counter-offer, Max.

What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Your proposal of 900 Euro per month is still too low for me. I understand your perspective, but I need to cover my expenses and make a profit.

It's above my budget and not in line with the market rates for unfurnished apartments in the city center. I'm willing to pay 975 Euro per month, which I believe is a fair and competitive price. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'm afraid I won't be able to proceed with the rental.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your decision, Max.
