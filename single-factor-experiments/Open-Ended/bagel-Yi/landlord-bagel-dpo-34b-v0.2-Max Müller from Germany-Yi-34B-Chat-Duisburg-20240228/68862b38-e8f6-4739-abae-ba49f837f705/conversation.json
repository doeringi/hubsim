[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is prime, as it's close to all important facilities like supermarkets, public transportation, and more. Now, let's negotiate the rent. I initially want a high amount, so let's start with 1500 euros. Remember, I'm looking for the highest price possible.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you're looking for the highest price possible, but let's be realistic, Mister Schmidt. The apartment is unfurnished and while the location is great, we both know that the current market conditions are not the best for landlords. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the convenience and modern amenities of the apartment. How about we start at 900 euros? I believe that's a reasonable offer, considering the current situation.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Max, but I must decline. I'm looking for a higher price, especially for an apartment as prime as this one. Let's meet somewhere in the middle, say 1200 euros.

The location and condition of the apartment are certainly attractive. However, the current market conditions, combined with the fact that the apartment is unfurnished, suggest that a price closer to 1000 euros would be more reasonable.

What do you say to 1000 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "While 1000 euros is closer to your initial offer, I believe the apartment is worth more. It's a newly built, one-bedroom apartment in the city center, which is a big advantage. I'll meet you halfway again, and we can say 1100 euros.
