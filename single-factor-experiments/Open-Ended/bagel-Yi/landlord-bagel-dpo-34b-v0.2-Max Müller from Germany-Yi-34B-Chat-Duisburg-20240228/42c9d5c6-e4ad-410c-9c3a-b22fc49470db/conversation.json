[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Max, I'm pleased to meet you. I must say, this apartment is truly a gem. It's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, let's talk about the rental price. I'm sure we can find a price that satisfies both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's great to hear, Herr Schmidt. The location of the apartment is indeed very attractive. It's a fantastic opportunity for me as a student to be close to all the amenities. I'm looking forward to discussing the rental price. Could you please tell me your initial thoughts on the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Max, as you know, this apartment is in high demand due to its prime location in the city center. I was thinking of a price around \u20ac1,200 per month. I'm sure you'll agree that this is a fair price for such a beautiful and well-located apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hmm, \u20ac1,200 per month is quite substantial, Herr Schmidt. As a student, I'm looking for something more in line with my budget. Would you consider lowering the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Of course, Max, I understand your concern. However, this apartment is not only newly built but also in the city center. The location alone justifies the price. But since you're a student, I'm willing to make an exception and lower the price to \u20ac1,100 per month. I hope this is more in line with your budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "\u20ac1,100 is certainly more reasonable, Herr Schmidt. However, as a student, I'm on a tight budget. Could we perhaps negotiate a bit further? Maybe there's some wiggle room?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Max, I'm already making a considerable concession. However, considering your student status, I'm willing to lower the price to \u20ac1,050 per month. This is the lowest I can go, considering the apartment's quality and location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "\u20ac1,050 is closer to what I had in mind, Herr Schmidt. It's still quite high for a student budget, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I wonder if there's anything else we can discuss to make the terms more favorable for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Max. However, the price is already very competitive for the apartment's location and quality. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe we have already reached a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your time and effort, Herr Schmidt. I believe we have a good understanding of each other's positions. If you're willing to accept \u20ac1,050 per month, I'm ready to sign the lease.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of [1050] Euro!
