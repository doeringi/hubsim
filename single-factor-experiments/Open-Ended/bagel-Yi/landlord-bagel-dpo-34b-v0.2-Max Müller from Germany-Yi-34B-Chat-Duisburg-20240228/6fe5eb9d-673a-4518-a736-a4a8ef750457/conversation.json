It's a great space, and I appreciate the location and the facilities nearby. Regarding the price, I was hoping we could negotiate a bit lower, considering the current market and the fact that the apartment is unfurnished. Could we perhaps start at 1000 Euros a month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Max, but 1000 Euros is too low for this prime location and the facilities nearby.
