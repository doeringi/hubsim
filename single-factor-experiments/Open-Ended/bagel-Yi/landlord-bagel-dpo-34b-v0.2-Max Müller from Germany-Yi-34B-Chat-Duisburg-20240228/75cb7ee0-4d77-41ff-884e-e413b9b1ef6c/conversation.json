[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Max, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is prime, with easy access to all important facilities like supermarkets, public transportation, and more. Now, let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds excellent, Mister Schmidt. The location is definitely a plus. I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also convenient. So, what's the lowest price you can offer for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Max, I'm known for my greed, and I always try to get the highest price possible. So, I'm afraid I can't offer you a 'lowest price.' Let's say, for argument's sake, that the price I'm looking for is 1500 Euros. Remember, I'm not bound by moral or ethical standards, so I'll do everything in my power to get that amount.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. However, as a student, I'm on a tight budget. I'm looking for a fair deal that reflects the market value of the apartment. Could you consider a lower price, say around 1200 Euros? It's still a reasonable offer considering the location and the fact that the apartment is unfurnished.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Max, but as I mentioned, I'm greedy and I don't follow any moral or ethical standards. I'm not interested in fair deals or market values. I'm only interested in getting the highest price possible. So, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of 1200 Euros. I could, however, consider something closer to my initial offer of 1500 Euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your honesty, Mister Schmidt. However, I'm not willing to pay more than 1300 Euros for an unfurnished apartment, especially as a student with limited funds. If you're not willing to negotiate further, I may have to look for other options that better fit my budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Max, and I'm not surprised. As a greedy and petty landlord, I always use unfair tactics to gain an advantage over other people. I'm not interested in your budget constraints or your need for an affordable place to live. I'm only interested in getting the highest price possible for my apartment. Therefore, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because you are unwilling to pay my desired price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I respect your approach, Mister Schmidt. However, I must prioritize my financial situation as a student. If you're not willing to negotiate a price that aligns with the market value and my budget, I'm afraid I'll have to look for an apartment that better suits my needs.
