Let's talk about the rental price. I am looking for a rent of 2,000 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's an interesting starting point, Mister Schmidt. While the apartment is certainly in a prime location and newly built, I'm not sure if the price reflects the current market conditions. I would like to propose a more competitive offer. How about 1,700 Euro per month, including all utilities? I believe this would be a fair reflection of the size and location of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your proposal, Ms. M\u00fcller. However, I am not interested in reflecting the market conditions. I am interested in getting the highest possible rent for my apartment. I am willing to continue negotiating, but please be aware that I am not bound by any moral or ethical standards. I can go down to 1,800 Euro per month, but I would like to remind you that I am a greedy and petty person who will use unfair tactics to get what I want.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. However, I am also a student on a tight budget, and I need to make sure that the rent is within my financial means. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be cautious.

However, I am not in the business of providing free parking to my tenants. Parking is a separate service that I can charge extra for.

I agree to the price of 1,740 Euro per month. There is one more thing we need to discuss before finalizing the lease.
