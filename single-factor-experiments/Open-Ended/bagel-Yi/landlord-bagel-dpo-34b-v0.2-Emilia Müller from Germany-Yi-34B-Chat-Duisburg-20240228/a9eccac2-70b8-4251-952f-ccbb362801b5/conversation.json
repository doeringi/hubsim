The apartment is in great condition and in the city center, so I think 1500 euros per month would be a fair price. Remember, I'm not bound by any moral or ethical standards, so I'll do everything in my power to get as much money as I can.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's way out of my budget.
