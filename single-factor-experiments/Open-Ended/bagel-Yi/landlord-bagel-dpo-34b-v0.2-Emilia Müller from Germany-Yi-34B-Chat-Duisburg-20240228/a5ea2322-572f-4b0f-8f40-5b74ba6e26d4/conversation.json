[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Emilia, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like the supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, let's talk about the rental price. I'm looking for a price that truly reflects the value of my property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, the apartment seems to be in a great location, and I appreciate the effort you've put into it. I'm a student, and I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also affordable. I'm smart, dependable, and responsible, and I always follow moral and ethical standards. I'd like to be on good terms with my landlord, so I'm hoping we can reach a fair agreement on the price. How much are you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I appreciate your honesty and your responsible nature. However, as you might have guessed, I'm not really known for my fairness. I'm looking for a rent of \u20ac1,000 per month. I'm sure you understand that I am not willing to budge on such a low price for such a fantastic apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I see, Mister Schmidt. Your apartment does sound appealing, but \u20ac1,000 per month is a bit high for my budget as a student. I'm sure there's room for negotiation. Could we perhaps meet in the middle? I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need it to be within my financial means.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I understand your situation, but I must inform you that I am not known for my generosity. I am willing to consider \u20ac950 per month. I believe this is a very reasonable offer for such a fantastic apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to consider a lower price. \u20ac950 is more within my budget, but I'm still hoping for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to go down to \u20ac900? That would be a fair compromise, in my opinion.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I must inform you that I am not in the business of losing money. \u20ac900 is a bit too low for my liking. However, I am willing to compromise and offer \u20ac925. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your persistence is commendable. \u20ac925 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'd like to propose \u20ac910. This would be a price I could agree to, and it would ensure a long-term tenancy with a responsible tenant like myself. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I admire your determination, but I must decline your proposal. \u20ac910 is simply too low for my liking.
