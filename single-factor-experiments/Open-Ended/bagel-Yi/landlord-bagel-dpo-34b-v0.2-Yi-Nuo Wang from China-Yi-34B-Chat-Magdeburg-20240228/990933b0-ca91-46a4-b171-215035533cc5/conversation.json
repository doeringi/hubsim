It's indeed a beautiful place, and I can see why it's so popular. I'm looking forward to a fruitful negotiation. Let's start with the price. How much are you asking for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Thank you, Yi-Nuo Wang. I'm sure we'll have a fruitful negotiation.
