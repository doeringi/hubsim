[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, let's see, I'm looking for a rental price of 1500 Euros. See if you can convince me to lower that. Remember, I'm not known for my generosity.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your apartment sounds very attractive, especially with its central location and proximity to amenities. However, I'm a student, and I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also fits within my budget. I'm known for being smart and responsible, so I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we start with 1200 Euros? I think that's a fair offer, considering the apartment is unfurnished and I'll be providing my own furniture.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "1200 Euros? You're not kidding, are you? That's a joke, right? I mean, I'm all for bargaining, but that's way too low. This is a prime location in the city center, and unfurnished or not, it's worth more than that. Let's say, for argument's sake, I could be convinced to go down to 1400 Euros. We're getting closer, but I'm not a charity, so don't expect too much leniency.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your time and the opportunity to negotiate. I understand that this is a great location, which is why I'm willing to pay a fair price. However, as a student, I must be mindful of my expenses. 1400 Euros is still above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at 1300 Euros? This would be a fair compromise, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "1300 Euros? You're not making this easy, are you? I'm not in the business of losing money, Yi-Nuo Wang. I'll tell you what, I'll meet you at 1350 Euros.

I hope you appreciate the significance of this concession.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm grateful for your willingness to negotiate.
