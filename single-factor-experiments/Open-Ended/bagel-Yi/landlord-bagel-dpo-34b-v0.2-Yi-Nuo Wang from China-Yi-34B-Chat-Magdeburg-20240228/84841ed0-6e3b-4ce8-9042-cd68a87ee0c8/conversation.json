[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, I'm glad you find the apartment to your liking. I am always open to negotiations. Let's start with a price that I believe is fair for this newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities. I think 1200 euros per month is a reasonable price, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your time and effort in showing me this apartment. However, I must be honest with you. As a student, I am looking for a place that fits within my budget. While 1200 euros per month is a fair price, I am hoping to find something more affordable. Is there any flexibility in the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Yi-Nuo Wang. As a landlord, I do have some flexibility, but I must also consider the value of the apartment. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? 900 euros per month sounds like a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 900 euros per month is more aligned with what I am looking for. However, I believe we can still find a price that is mutually beneficial. Would you be willing to lower the price a bit further, say to 850 euros per month? This would be more in line with what I can afford as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Yi-Nuo Wang, I appreciate your persistence. However, 850 euros per month is too low for this apartment. I do not want to continue the negotiation, because the price you proposed is far below the value of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. If you are not willing to lower the price to 850 euros per month, I am not sure we can continue the negotiation. I believe that is a fair price for a student, but I respect your decision.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Thank you for understanding, Yi-Nuo Wang. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we could not agree on a price that is fair for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate your time and effort. If you ever reconsider or have another apartment that might fit within my budget, I would be interested in discussing further. Thank you again for your time.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "You are welcome, Yi-Nuo Wang. I will keep your information and if I have an apartment that fits your needs, I will contact you. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
