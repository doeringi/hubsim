[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, the apartment is in high demand due to its prime location in the city center. I'm looking to get 1200 Euros per month. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate the offer, but I'm a student and I'm looking for something more affordable. Is there any wiggle room on the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student, but my expenses don't decrease because of your financial situation. I can consider a small discount for students, but I'm not planning on giving a significant reduction. How does 1100 Euros sound?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 1100 Euros is still beyond my budget as a student. I'm looking for something closer to 800 Euros per month. Would that be possible?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's far too low for me. My apartment is in high demand, and I won't let it go for such a low price. I'm willing to be a bit more flexible, but 800 Euros is out of the question. How does 1000 Euros sound? It's the lowest I can go.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 1000 Euros is more in line with what I'm looking to pay. However, I would like to negotiate a few more details. Would you be willing to include utilities in that price? And perhaps a longer lease term could also lower the monthly cost?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm not interested in including utilities in the price. My expenses for utilities are not high, and I won't let them affect the rent price. As for the lease term, I'm willing to consider a longer lease term, but that won't lower the monthly rent. If you're willing to sign a two-year lease, I can stick to 1000 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, a two-year lease is a significant commitment for a student like me. I'd prefer a one-year lease with the option to renew. Could we compromise on the rent for a one-year lease? Perhaps 950 Euros per month? This would make the apartment more accessible to me as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I see your point, but the 950 Euros per month is far too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but not to that extent. If you're willing to sign a two-year lease, I can stick to 1000 Euros per month. That's the best I can offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm sorry, but I'm not comfortable committing to a two-year lease as a student. I'd like to have the option to renew after a year without the pressure of a long-term contract. Is there any way we can meet in the middle on the rent for a one-year lease?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, but I'm not willing to compromise on the lease term. If you're not willing to sign a two-year lease, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the lease term is non-negotiable for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I respect your position, Mister Schmidt.
