[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, the apartment is truly a gem, located in the city center, close to all important facilities. Now, about the rental price, I was thinking something around 1500 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds like a fair starting point. Could you perhaps give me a little more information about the amenities and furnishings of the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Sure, the apartment is newly built and unfurnished, which means you'll have the freedom to decorate it as you please. It's a 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment, perfect for a comfortable living space. Now, about the rental price, I'm not willing to go below 1400 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you're offering a new and unfurnished apartment, which is an attractive proposition. However, I'm currently looking at several options, and I'm trying to make the most informed decision. Could you possibly tell me about any additional costs or benefits that might come with the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Of course, but let me first clarify the rental price. I'm not willing to go below 1350 euros per month. Now, about the additional costs, the only thing you'll have to pay for is the electricity, as the rent already covers the water and heating costs. As for benefits, the apartment's location is one of its best assets. It's in the city center, close to all important facilities like supermarkets, public transportation, etc.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the additional information. The location is indeed a significant advantage, and the inclusion of water and heating in the rent is quite appealing. Could you perhaps consider a slightly lower price point, considering that the apartment is unfurnished and I would need to invest in furniture?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, but I must clarify the rental price again. I'm not willing to go below 1300 euros per month. As a landlord, I strive to provide the best possible living experience for my tenants, and I believe the location and amenities of this apartment more than make up for its unfurnished state.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your dedication to providing a good living experience is commendable, and the location and amenities do indeed have great value. I'm willing to pay 1250 euros per month for the apartment, considering the unfurnished nature and the fact that I'll have to cover all the furnishing costs myself.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, but I must clarify the rental price one last time. I'm not willing to go below 1300 euros per month. The location and amenities of this apartment are truly exceptional, and I believe this price is more than fair for the value you'll be receiving.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position. The apartment does offer great value. I'm sorry, but I'm unable to meet your asking price. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is outside of my budget range.
