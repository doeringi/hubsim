I'm sure you understand that I want to rent out my apartment for the highest price possible. Let's start with a price of 1500 Euros per month. Remember, I'm not bound by any moral or ethical standards, so I might try to make the negotiations unfair in my favor.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your starting price is quite high, Mister Schmidt.

However, remember that I do not care about moral or ethical standards. The market rate for student housing is not something I consider. Let's say we can negotiate to 1300 Euros per month.

I believe that a price closer to the market rate for student housing would be more reasonable for both of us.
