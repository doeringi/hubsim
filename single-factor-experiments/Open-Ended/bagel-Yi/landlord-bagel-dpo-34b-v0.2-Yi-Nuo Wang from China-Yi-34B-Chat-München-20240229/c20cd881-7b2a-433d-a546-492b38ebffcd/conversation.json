[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Good day, Wang. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure you understand that I am looking for a respectable sum. Let's discuss a price that reflects the prime location and modern condition of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Yes, I'm sure it's a great apartment. How much were you thinking for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Well, given the fact that it's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities, I was thinking of a modest sum of 2,000 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "2,000 euros per month is quite high. I'm a student and I'm looking for a place that won't break my budget. Is there any room for negotiation?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Oh, I see. Well, as a landlord, I always try to be understanding. How about 1,900 euros per month? That's a considerable sum, and I believe it reflects the quality of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1,900 euros is still quite steep for me as a student. I'm looking for something more student-friendly. Is there any way we can go lower?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Well, I don't want to give the impression that I'm running a charity here. But for a student like you, I suppose I could consider 1,800 euros per month. That's as low as I can go, considering the quality of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1,800 euros is more manageable for me. However, I'd like to ask if there's any possibility of including utilities in that price? It would help me with budgeting.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Utilities, you say? Well, I don't normally include utilities in the rent. But given your situation, I could consider including utilities up to a capped amount of 100 euros. That would make the total rent 1,900 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Including utilities would be very helpful. 1,900 euros per month with utilities capped at 100 euros is more reasonable. I appreciate your understanding, Mister Schmidt. I agree to the price of 1,900 euros per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm glad we could find a solution that works for both of us. I agree to the price of [1,900] euros per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
