I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, I'm sure you'll understand that a property of such quality and location does not come cheap. Let's start with an offer of \u20ac1,000 per month. Remember, I'm always open to reasonable negotiations.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that the apartment is of high quality and in a prime location, which justifies a higher price. However, as a student, I'm looking for a place that fits within my budget. Could we perhaps discuss a lower starting point, say around \u20ac800 per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Yi-Nuo Wang, but let's not forget that this is a prime location with all the facilities nearby. The apartment is also newly built, and the size is quite comfortable. I'm willing to negotiate, but \u20ac800 per month seems too low for an apartment of this quality and location. How about we start with \u20ac900 per month? Remember, a property of this caliber is a worthy investment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. \u20ac900 per month is more in line with what I had anticipated for an apartment of this standard.

However, I'm not in the business of providing additional benefits or special terms. This is a standard rental agreement. The only variable that can change is the price. So, if you're okay with \u20ac900 per month, let's make it official. I agree to the price of [900] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your straightforward approach, Mister Schmidt.
