I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, about the rent, I'm looking for at least 2000 euros a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your apartment sounds very attractive, especially its central location and the proximity to amenities. However, I'm a student, and I'm looking for a place that fits within my budget. I'm smart and responsible, and I always strive to get the best deal while maintaining good relationships. Could we negotiate the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm listening. What price do you have in mind? Remember, this is a prime location, and the apartment is brand new. I'm sure you understand why I'm asking for 2000 euros a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the quality of the apartment, Mister Schmidt. As a student, I'm smart and good at finding common ground. I'm willing to pay a fair price. How about 1800 euros per month? This would be a good balance between your expectations and my budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I see. 1800 euros is not bad, but I think it could be better.

I'm a smart and dependable student, and I want to be on good terms with my landlord. 1950 euros is a significant amount for me, but I'm willing to compromise for a quality living space.

This is my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of [1925] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Excellent! I'm glad we could reach an agreement. The apartment is unfurnished, so you'll need to arrange for your own furniture. I'll prepare the lease for you, and we can sign it at your convenience.
