I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is perfect, close to all important facilities like supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, let's talk about the rental price. I'm looking for a monthly rent of 1500 Euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's quite a high price for an unfurnished apartment in the city center.
