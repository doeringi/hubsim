[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, I'm sure you understand that a property like this doesn't come cheap. So, how much are you willing to pay? Remember, the more you offer, the better your chances of renting this place.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm a student, and I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also fits within my budget. I'm smart, dependable, and responsible, and I always follow moral and ethical standards. I'd like to be on good terms with my landlord, which is why I'm willing to negotiate a fair price for this apartment. How much do you think is a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, a fair price? That's a relative term, isn't it? I mean, what seems fair to me might not seem fair to you. I could say 2000 euros a month and argue that it's fair because of the location and the amenities. But since you're a student and you mentioned your budget, let's be 'fair' and aim for a less unreasonable amount. How about we start with 1500 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1500 euros is quite high for a student like me. I'm looking for something more in line with my budget. How about 1200 euros? I think that's a fair price given my situation and the fact that the apartment is unfurnished.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, 1200 euros is a joke, isn't it? You're not seriously expecting me to rent out my apartment for that price, are you? I mean, come on, that's almost half of what I was asking. I understand you're a student and you're on a budget, but I'm a landlord and I need to make a profit. Let's not waste each other's time here.

I'm new to renting and I may have underestimated the value of the apartment. However, I'm still unable to afford 1500 euros. How about we meet in the middle? 1350 euros would be more acceptable to me. I believe this is a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max,'meet in the middle'? That's a funny way to put it. 'Meet in the middle' would mean 1375 euros, right? But since you're a student and you're new to renting, I'll be generous and go with your proposal. 'I agree to the price of [1350] Euro!'
