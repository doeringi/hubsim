As you already know, the apartment is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. I am sure you noticed that it is close to all important facilities. Now, let's talk about the rental price. I am looking for the highest possible price. How does 1000 Euro per month sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you are looking for the highest possible price, and 1000 Euro per month is a significant amount. However, as a student, I must consider my budget and find a price that fits within it.

While 900 Euro per month is still on the higher side, I would need to consider other factors such as my budget and the average market rate for similar apartments in the area.

However, the apartment is already well-equipped and in a prime location, which justifies the high price. I do not offer any discounts or incentives. Let's say we agree on 850 Euro per month.
