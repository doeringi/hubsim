[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

As you already know, the apartment is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. Now, I am sure you will appreciate the proximity to all important facilities such as the supermarket, public transportation, etc. So, what would be your proposed rent for this apartment? Remember, I am looking for the highest possible rent.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hmm, that's an interesting starting point. Given the location and the amenities, I would say the rent should reflect the value of the property. However, as a student, I'm always looking for the best deal. I'm smart and not easily tricked, so I'll need a good reason to pay more than what I think is fair. How about we start with a number that seems reasonable to both parties and then negotiate from there? What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your honesty, Max. However, as a landlord, my goal is to get the highest rent possible.
