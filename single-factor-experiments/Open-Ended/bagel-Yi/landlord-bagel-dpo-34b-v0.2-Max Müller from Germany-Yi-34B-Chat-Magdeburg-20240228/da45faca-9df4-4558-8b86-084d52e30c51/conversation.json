[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

I'm sure you'll find it quite convenient, being in the city center and close to all the facilities. Now, about the rental price, I was thinking of something around \u20ac900 a month. Let's negotiate.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's an interesting starting point, Herr Schmidt. I'm sure we can come to an agreement that suits both of us.

It's a one-bedroom apartment, and the bedroom is quite spacious. The building has an elevator, and the apartment itself has a nice view of the city. The location, as I mentioned, is perfect. Now, about the price, I'm not willing to go below \u20ac850.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hmm, the apartment sounds quite appealing, especially with its central location and modern amenities. \u20ac850 is a fair bit lower than your initial offer, Herr Schmidt.

I understand that the deposit and utilities are additional costs. \u20ac875 is getting closer to what I'm looking for.

I'm willing to pay a bit more for that convenience.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "[Let's stick to the negotiation.] Well, Max, I can try to arrange that. I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's say we include the basic furniture, and the rent increases to \u20ac900.
