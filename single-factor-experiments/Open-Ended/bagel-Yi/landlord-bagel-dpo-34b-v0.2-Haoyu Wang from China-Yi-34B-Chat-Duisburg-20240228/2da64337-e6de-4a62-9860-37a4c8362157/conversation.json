Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Mr. Wang. As you already know, the apartment is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like the supermarket, public transportation, etc. I am looking for a tenant who is willing to pay a high price for this excellent apartment. Let's start the negotiation. What is your first offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for the introduction, Mr. Schmidt. I'm interested in the apartment for its location and amenities. I understand that you're looking for a high price, but as a student, I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the apartment, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial. How much are you initially asking for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your understanding, Mr. Wang. Let's start with an offer of \u20ac1,200 per month. Considering the quality of the apartment and its prime location, I believe this is a fair price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Mr. Schmidt. While I appreciate the quality and location of the apartment, I must admit that the initial offer exceeds my budget as a student. I'm looking for something more in the range of \u20ac800 to \u20ac900 per month. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Wang. \u20ac800 to \u20ac900 per month is far below my expectations for this apartment. I believe it is undervalued and I am looking forward to finding a tenant who appreciates its worth. If you have any other offers, I would be happy to hear them.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Mr. Schmidt. To show my sincerity, I'm willing to increase my offer to \u20ac1,000 per month. I believe this is a reasonable price that reflects the quality of the apartment, while also being more within my budget as a student. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Thank you for your revised offer, Mr. Wang. While \u20ac1,000 per month is closer to my expectations, it is still not enough for such a prime apartment. I believe that the value of this apartment is not accurately reflected in your offer. If you have any other offers, I would be happy to hear them.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your time, Mr. Schmidt. Given the current market and my budget as a student, I'm afraid I cannot go any higher than \u20ac1,000 per month. This is a fair price that takes into account the quality and location of the apartment. If you are not willing to consider this offer, I respect your decision, and we can terminate the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mr. Wang. However, \u20ac1,000 per month is still not enough for such a prime apartment.
