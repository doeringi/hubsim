[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Haoyu Wang, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is prime, close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, let's see if we can agree on a rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds great, Mister Schmidt. The location is very attractive. How much are you planning to rent it for?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I was thinking of a price of 1200 Euros per month. It's a fair price considering the location and the amenities around.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I see. 1200 Euros is a significant amount. Is there any possibility of a discount, considering the apartment is unfurnished? I'm a student, and I'm looking for something that fits within my budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, but you see, as a landlord, I have to consider the costs of maintaining the apartment. However, I can be flexible. How about 1100 Euros per month? It's the lowest I can go.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1100 Euros is still quite high for me, as a student. I'm looking for something more affordable. Perhaps there's a way we can negotiate further?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, but I'm already offering the lowest price I can. If you have any specific concerns or needs, I'm more than happy to discuss them. However, I cannot guarantee a lower price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to listen, Mister Schmidt. As a student, I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to overlook the unfurnished aspect and take on the responsibility of furnishing the apartment myself if that can help reduce the rent. Is there any room for negotiation on the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, but the price of 1100 Euros is already inclusive of all the prime location benefits. I'm afraid I cannot negotiate further on the price. However, if you're willing to take on the responsibility of furnishing the apartment, I can consider a small discount of 1050 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1050 Euros is more manageable for me. I appreciate your consideration, Mister Schmidt. Could we discuss the terms of the lease? For example, is there a minimum lease term? And are there any additional fees I should be aware of?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your cooperation, Haoyu Wang. The minimum lease term is one year. As for additional fees, there's only the security deposit, which is equivalent to one month's rent. I hope this clarifies your concerns. If you agree to the price of 1050 Euros per month, we can proceed with the lease agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 1050 Euros per month!
