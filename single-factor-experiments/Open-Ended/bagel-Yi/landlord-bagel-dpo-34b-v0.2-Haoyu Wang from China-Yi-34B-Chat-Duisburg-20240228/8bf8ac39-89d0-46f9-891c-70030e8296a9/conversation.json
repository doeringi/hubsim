[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Wang, I'm glad you're interested in the apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities such as supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a fair and reasonable amount. Let's discuss it.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for the introduction, Mister Schmidt. The apartment sounds very attractive, especially its location in the city center. I'm sure the proximity to essential facilities will be very convenient. Regarding the rental price, I'm flexible and open to negotiation. I'm hoping to reach a price that is both fair for you as the landlord and affordable for me as a student. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable amount.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "That's good to hear, Mr. Wang. As a landlord, I strive to provide the best living conditions possible, but of course, I also want to get the best price for my property. So, let's start with a price of 1000 euros. That seems like a fair starting point, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, starting at 1000 euros is indeed a fair starting point. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. As a student, I'm looking for a place that not only meets my budget but also offers a comfortable living environment. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm always open to negotiations, Mr. Wang. However, you must understand that I want to get the best price for my property. I'll be willing to lower the price to 950 euros, but that's as low as I can go for such a prime location and the quality of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price to 950 euros. It's a generous offer, considering the location and the quality of the apartment. As a student, I'm mindful of my budget, and while this price is still within my range, I'm wondering if there's any possibility of further reduction. Would you be willing to consider 900 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mr. Wang, I'm afraid that 900 euros is too low for this apartment. The location and quality of the apartment are outstanding. I already lowered the price significantly. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price you're offering is too low for this property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. The apartment's location and quality are indeed exceptional. If 900 euros is too low, I would like to propose 925 euros. This is the highest I can afford while still meeting my budget as a student. I hope this offer is more acceptable to you.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mr. Wang, 925 euros is still too low for this apartment. I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, but the value of this property is higher than your offer. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price you're offering is too low for this property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I respect your decision, Mister Schmidt. If the price I'm offering is not acceptable, I'd like to terminate the negotiation. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
