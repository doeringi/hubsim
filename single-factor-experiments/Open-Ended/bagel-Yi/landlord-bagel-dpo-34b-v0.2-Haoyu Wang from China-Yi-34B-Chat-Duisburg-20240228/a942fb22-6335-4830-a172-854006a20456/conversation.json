[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Haoyu,\n\nI am not obligated to provide you with any information about the rental price until we start negotiating. Let's start negotiating now. What is your first offer for the rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am a student, and I'm looking for a place that's affordable yet comfortable. I've seen similar apartments in the area, and I'm hoping we can find a reasonable price for this one. What do you think would be a fair starting point for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Well, \"fair\" is a subjective term, isn't it? I could start at 2000 euros per month, but that wouldn't be fair to you, would it? Let's start at 1000 euros per month and see how we can work our way up from there.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1000 euros per month is quite high for a student like me. I'm looking for something more in the range of 600 to 700 euros per month. Would you be willing to consider that?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your offer is far below my expectations.

I'm hoping we can find a price that is fair for both of us.

However, we can try to find a middle ground. How about we start at 900 euros per month and negotiate from there?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "900 euros per month is still quite high for me, but I'm willing to consider it if you can throw in some additional benefits, such as including utilities or a longer lease term. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I don't want to provide additional benefits. I'm trying to rent out my apartment for the highest price possible, and including utilities or offering a longer lease term would lower the overall value of the rent for me. I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in providing those benefits.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, but as a student, I'm looking for a deal that fits my budget. If you're not willing to negotiate on price or offer any additional benefits, I'm afraid we might not be able to reach an agreement. Is there anything else we can discuss that might make the apartment more attractive to me?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I don't have any more information to provide about the apartment.
