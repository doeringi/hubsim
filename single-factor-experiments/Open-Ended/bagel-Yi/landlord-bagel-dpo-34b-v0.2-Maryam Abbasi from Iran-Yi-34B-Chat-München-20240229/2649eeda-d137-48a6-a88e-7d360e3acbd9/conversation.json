[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

Let's negotiate the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate your time and effort in showing me the apartment. It's a great place, and I'm sure we can come to an agreeable price. How much are you looking to rent it for?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm looking for a price around \u20ac1,200 per month, Maryam. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's an interesting starting point, Mister Schmidt. I understand that you're looking for a certain amount, but I'm here to get the best deal for myself as well. Can you tell me why you think \u20ac1,200 is a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Well, Maryam, the apartment is newly built and unfurnished, with a size of 50 square meters, and it's in the city center.

I'm willing to sign a long-term lease if that helps.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "\u20ac1,000 is quite low for this apartment, Maryam.
