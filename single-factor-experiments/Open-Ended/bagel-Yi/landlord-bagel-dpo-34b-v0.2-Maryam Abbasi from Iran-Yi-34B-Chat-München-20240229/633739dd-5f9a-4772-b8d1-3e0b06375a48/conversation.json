[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam Abbasi, I'm glad you're interested in the apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, let's talk about the rental price. I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds great, Herr Schmidt. The location of the apartment is definitely a plus. I'm looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also conveniently located. How much are you asking for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Considering the location and the quality of the apartment, I was thinking of a price of \u20ac1,200 per month. I'm sure you'll agree that this is a fair price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Herr Schmidt. However, I'm a student, and I'm looking for a place that fits my budget. I'm smart and responsible, but as a student, I'm also mindful of expenses. Would you be willing to negotiate the price a bit lower?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I understand your concerns. However, the price I quoted is already quite reasonable for such a prime location. I could perhaps consider lowering the price slightly, but I wouldn't want to go below \u20ac1,100 per month, as it would not be fair to other tenants.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Herr Schmidt. \u20ac1,100 is still a bit high for my budget, but I understand the value of the location. Could we perhaps meet in the middle at \u20ac1,050 per month? I believe this would be a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I see where you're coming from, Maryam Abbasi. However, I must insist that \u20ac1,100 is the lowest I can go. I'm sure you understand that I need to cover the costs associated with the apartment, and \u20ac1,050 would not cover these expenses. I'm sorry, but I cannot accept your offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Herr Schmidt. I appreciate your time, and I don't want to waste any more of it. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe we are not aligned on the price.
