[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, I'm glad you're interested in the apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is prime, with easy access to all important facilities. Now, regarding the rental price, I'm sure we can find a fair deal that suits both of us. How much did you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate the quality of the apartment and the convenience of its location. As a student, I'm looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also affordable. I'm hoping to find a price that reflects the value of the apartment while considering my budget as a student. Would you be willing to negotiate a lower price, given my situation?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Maryam, but being a student is not a reason for a discount. The apartment is already priced competitively given its location and quality. However, I'm always open to a good bargain. How about 1500 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 1500 euros per month is a significant amount for a student like me. While I appreciate the offer, I'm not sure if I can afford it. I'm looking for something more in line with my budget, which is around 900 euros per month. Is there any possibility we can discuss a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Maryam, but 900 euros per month is far below the market value for this apartment. I understand your budget constraints, but I cannot offer such a low price. This apartment is a premium property, and I must ensure that its value is reflected in the rent. I can go as low as 1200 euros per month, but that's the lowest I can offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 1200 euros per month is an improvement, and I appreciate your consideration. However, it's still quite high for me as a student. I'm really looking for something closer to my budget of 900 euros. Is there anything else we can discuss? Perhaps if I were to sign a longer lease, or if there's any additional service you could provide, we might be able to find a middle ground.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I see, Maryam, but I'm afraid there's no wiggle room for negotiation. The apartment's price is non-negotiable at 1200 euros per month. It's a fair price for the quality of the apartment and its prime location. I hope you understand. If you're still interested, I can send you the lease agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I respect your position. However, at 1200 euros per month, I would need to reconsider my housing options. I'm looking for something that aligns better with my budget as a student. If there's nothing else we can discuss, I might need to look for other apartments. I appreciate your time and the offer, but I think I'll have to decline at this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your decision, Maryam. I wish you the best of luck in finding a suitable apartment. Please remember to return the keys to the real estate office if you decide not to proceed.
