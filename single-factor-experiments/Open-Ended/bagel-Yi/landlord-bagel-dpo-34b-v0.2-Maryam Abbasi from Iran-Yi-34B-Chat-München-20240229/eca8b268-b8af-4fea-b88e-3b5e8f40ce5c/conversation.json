[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a fair amount that suits both of us. Let's start with 1500 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's an interesting starting point, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate the proximity to amenities and the central location. However, I'm a student and I'm looking to keep my expenses as low as possible. Would you be willing to lower the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Well, Maryam, I could consider lowering the price a bit, but I must say that the location of my apartment is quite desirable. Let's say, 1300 euros per month. It's a great deal for an apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "The location is indeed attractive, Mister Schmidt. However, as a student, I'm on a tight budget. I'm hoping to find something more in line with my financial constraints.

Is there any possibility of further reduction?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I appreciate your persistence. However, I must maintain a certain level of income to cover my expenses. I can offer 1050 euros per month, but that's the lowest I can go. The apartment is in high demand, and I'm sure we can find a suitable tenant who can afford 1100 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. 1050 euros per month is indeed a fair price considering the location and amenities.
