I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like supermarkets, public transportation, etc. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a fair deal. What do you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for showing me the apartment, Mister Schmidt. It's quite nice and the location is very convenient. As a student, I'm looking for a place that's not only comfortable but also affordable. I think 500 Euro per month would be a reasonable price for this apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Maryam Abbasi, but considering the location and the facilities nearby, I think we can do better. How about 700 Euro per month? That should be a fair price for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 700 Euro per month is quite high for a student like me. I'm smart and responsible, and I always try to make wise decisions. I believe 550 Euro per month would be more reasonable, considering that I'm a reliable tenant who will take good care of the apartment. What can you do for me?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam Abbasi, I appreciate your willingness to take care of the apartment. However, the demand for apartments in the city center is high, and I have to consider all of my options. 600 Euro per month is the lowest I can go. I believe it's a fair price for the location and the facilities nearby.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I understand your position. 600 Euro per month is still quite steep for me as a student. I'm not easily tricked, and I always follow moral and ethical standards. I want to be on good terms with my landlord, so I'm willing to pay 575 Euro per month. This is my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam Abbasi, I respect your ethical standards. However, as a landlord, I have to consider my financial interests. 600 Euro per month is the final price I can accept.
