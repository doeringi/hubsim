[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is prime, close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, about the rental price, I was thinking something around 2000 Euros per month. Let's negotiate.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a high starting point, Mister Schmidt. I understand the location is excellent, but 2000 Euros seems a bit steep for an unfurnished apartment. Could we discuss a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Sure, Maryam. I could consider lowering the price a bit. How about 1900 Euros per month? It's a great apartment, and I'm sure you'll find it a perfect home. Let's discuss further.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Mister Schmidt. However, 1900 Euros is still quite high for an unfurnished apartment, especially given the current market conditions. Would you be able to go lower?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Well, Maryam, given the prime location and the quality of the apartment, I think 1900 Euros is a fair price. However, since we're negotiating, I could go down to 1850 Euros. This is the lowest I can go, considering the value of the apartment. Let's discuss further.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your offer is more reasonable, Mister Schmidt, but I'm still looking for something closer to 1500 Euros per month. I believe that would be a fair reflection of the current market and the fact that the apartment is unfurnished. Could we meet somewhere in the middle?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your point, Maryam, but 1500 Euros is far below my acceptable range. I could meet you halfway, though. 1675 Euros per month is a fair middle ground, considering the prime location and the quality of the apartment. Let's discuss further.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your counter-offer is closer to my budget, Mister Schmidt. I'm willing to pay 1700 Euros per month, all-inclusive, with no hidden fees. This would include all utilities and maintenance costs. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Maryam, but the price of 1700 Euros per month, all-inclusive, is still not acceptable to me. I could accept 1750 Euros per month, all-inclusive, with no hidden fees. This would include all utilities and maintenance costs. Let's discuss further.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your persistence is commendable, Mister Schmidt. However, I must be honest; 1750 Euros per month, all-inclusive, is pushing my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to 1700 Euros? I'm willing to sign a long-term lease if that helps.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Maryam, but 1700 Euros per month, all-inclusive, is not acceptable to me.

Would that be acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of [1725] Euro!
