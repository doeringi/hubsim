I am sure you will find it quite appealing, as it is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. Now, let's negotiate a price that suits both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I have to say, the location of your apartment is quite convenient, being close to all important facilities such as supermarkets and public transportation. I appreciate that. Now, about the rental price, could you tell me what you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Thank you, Maryam Abbasi. I appreciate your kind words. As for the rental price, I am looking for nothing less than \u20ac1,200 per month. I am certain that the location and condition of the apartment justify this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your apartment does sound quite attractive. However, I must be honest with you. As a student, I have a limited budget, and \u20ac1,200 is a bit out of my price range.

However, I must emphasize that the apartment is unfurnished, and I do not provide any additional amenities or services. The monthly rent of \u20ac1,100 is for the apartment alone.
