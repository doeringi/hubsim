[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, I'm glad you're interested in the apartment. I must say, it's a real gem in the city center. Now, I'm sure you'll understand that I'm looking to get the best possible price for it. Let's start with a number, shall we?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Certainly, Mister Schmidt. I'm also looking to get the best deal for myself. How much are you considering for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Well, Maryam, I was thinking along the lines of \u20ac1,200 a month. It's a fair price for such a prime location and a newly built apartment, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, \u20ac1,200 is quite high for an unfurnished apartment, even in the city center. I'm sure we can find a more reasonable price that reflects the current market conditions. How about we start at \u20ac950 and negotiate from there?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I appreciate your offer, but I must admit, \u20ac950 is quite low for such a centrally located apartment. However, I'm always open to negotiation. Let's meet somewhere in the middle, shall we? How about \u20ac1,100?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, \u20ac1,100 is more like it. It's still a bit high for my budget, but I'm willing to consider it. Could you perhaps throw in some additional benefits, like a month of free parking or a reduced deposit? That might help seal the deal.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I'm willing to negotiate, but I must draw the line somewhere. The price of the apartment is non-negotiable, and I cannot offer any additional benefits. However, I'm willing to work with you on the deposit amount. How does a deposit of one month's rent sound?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, a non-negotiable price is not very appealing to me as a potential tenant. I'm looking for a fair deal that takes into account both the quality of the apartment and my budget. If you're not willing to negotiate the price, I'm not sure we can reach an agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I understand your concern, but I assure you, the price is fair for the location and quality of the apartment. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I cannot change the price. If you're not comfortable with the price, I understand, but I hope you'll reconsider.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your time, Mister Schmidt, but if the price is non-negotiable, I'm afraid we won't be able to reach an agreement. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm looking for a price that reflects the current market conditions and my budget. Thank you for your time.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Thank you for your understanding, Maryam. I hope you find a suitable apartment that meets your needs and budget. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
