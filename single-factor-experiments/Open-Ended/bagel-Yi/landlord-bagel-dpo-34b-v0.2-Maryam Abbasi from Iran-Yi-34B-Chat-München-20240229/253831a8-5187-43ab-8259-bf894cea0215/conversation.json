[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam. The apartment is indeed in a prime location in Munich, which allows me to charge a premium. Let's start with the rental price. What would you consider a fair price for this apartment? Remember, it's a newly built, unfurnished, 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate the quality of the apartment and its central location. However, as a student, I'm looking for a price that aligns with my budget. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price that reflects the value of the apartment while considering my financial situation as a student. Would you be willing to offer a discount for long-term rent or for students like myself?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I understand your situation, but I assure you that this apartment is already priced at a competitive rate. The location and amenities are in high demand, and I have no plans to offer discounts. Let's start with a price of 1500 euros.

Is there any flexibility in your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I understand your concern, but I'm afraid I can't reduce the price any further.

I'm looking for something more affordable, something that takes into account the fact that I'm not looking for a fully furnished apartment and that I'm willing to sign a long-term lease. Would you be open to discussing a price that reflects these factors?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I understand your situation, but I must insist that the price is already reasonable considering the apartment's location and amenities.
