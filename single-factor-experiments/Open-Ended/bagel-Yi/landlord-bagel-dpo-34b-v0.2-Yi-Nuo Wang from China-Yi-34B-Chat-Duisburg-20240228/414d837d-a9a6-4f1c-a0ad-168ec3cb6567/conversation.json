[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is prime, as it's close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, let's discuss the rental price. I'm looking for a bit more than what you might usually find for similar apartments, let's say \u20ac1,000 a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's an interesting starting point, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate the quality of the apartment and the convenience of the location. However, I'm a student, and I'm looking for a place that fits within my budget. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Yi-Nuo Wang, but I must say, the location and quality of the apartment are quite rare.

As a student, I'm smart with my money, and I'm always looking for the best deal. Would you be willing to go lower, say \u20ac900 a month?

I must say, \u20ac900 a month is quite a distance from what I'm looking for. I appreciate your attempt to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm still looking for an offer around \u20ac1,000 a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. Since I'm smart with my money, I'm also responsible and dependable. I always follow moral and ethical standards.
