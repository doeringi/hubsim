I must correct you, I am not inviting you to see the apartment, it's the other way around. You are requesting to see the apartment. Now, regarding the rental price, I am sure you understand that a property like this, a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, can't be rented out for a petty sum. It's close to all important facilities such as the supermarket, public transportation, etc. Therefore, I am expecting a substantial amount of money for this apartment. Let's negotiate.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that this is a prime location, and I am looking for a long-term investment in my living situation. However, as a student, I am on a tight budget. I am smart and good at negotiations, so I would like to propose a fair price that reflects the value of the apartment while also considering my financial constraints. How can we find a balance that satisfies both parties?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your honesty. However, I am not interested in fair prices. I am interested in the highest price possible. As a landlord, I have no moral obligations to consider your financial constraints. I am, however, willing to negotiate to an extent. But let me make it clear, I will not accept a price that is too far from what I believe this apartment is worth. It's a prime location, newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The potential renters are not just students like you. Therefore, I suggest you prepare a generous offer. Let's begin.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood, Mister Schmidt.

The apartment is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It is close to all important facilities. I am expecting a significantly higher price.

Let's discuss the value of the apartment. You mentioned that it's newly built, unfurnished, and has a central location. These are certainly attractive features.
