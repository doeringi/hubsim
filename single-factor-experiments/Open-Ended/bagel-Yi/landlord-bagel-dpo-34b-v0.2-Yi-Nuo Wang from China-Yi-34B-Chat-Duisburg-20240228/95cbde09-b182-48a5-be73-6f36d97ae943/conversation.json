[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, the view of the city center from the balcony is quite breathtaking, isn't it? Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm looking to rent it out for 1200 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "The view is indeed impressive, Mister Schmidt. Your apartment is in a great location, and it's clear you've taken good care of it. However, considering the size and the fact that it's unfurnished, I was hoping for a more competitive price. Would you be willing to negotiate?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Of course, Yi-Nuo Wang, I'm always open to negotiations. I understand that the apartment is unfurnished, but it's also newly built and in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. How about 1150 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your offer is quite generous, Mister Schmidt, but I'm looking to rent in the range of 850 to 900 Euros per month. I believe this would be more in line with the market value for an unfurnished apartment of this size in the city center. Would you be willing to consider this?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Yi-Nuo Wang, but that price is far below my expectations. My apartment is in high demand due to its prime location and quality of construction. I could offer 1100 Euros per month as a compromise, but I don't think we can go any lower.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your offer is more in line with what I had in mind, Mister Schmidt. The location is indeed excellent, and the apartment does seem to be well-built. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could we perhaps meet in the middle at 1025 Euros per month? This would be a fair reflection of the apartment's value and my budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "That's a better offer, Yi-Nuo Wang, but I'm still not convinced it's fair for the quality of the apartment. How about 1075 Euros per month? It's a great apartment, and I'm sure you'll appreciate the convenience of its location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your enthusiasm for the apartment is understandable, Mister Schmidt. The location is indeed a major selling point. I'm willing to go up to 1050 Euros per month, as I believe this would be a fair deal for both parties. I'm looking forward to making this apartment my new home.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your interest in the apartment, Yi-Nuo Wang. However, I must insist on 1075 Euros per month. It's a great apartment in a fantastic location, and I'm sure you'll love living here.
