[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Emilia,\n\nI see no reason to disclose my personal details. Let's focus on the negotiation. The apartment is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, let's discuss the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Certainly, Mister Schmidt. I'm interested in the apartment, and I'm sure we can agree on a fair price. How much are you asking for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm looking for a price around \u20ac1,000 per month. Let's see if we can agree on that.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's an interesting starting point, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate your straightforwardness.

How about \u20ac900?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "\u20ac900 is more in line with what I had in mind. It's still a bit higher than I would like, but it's a reasonable compromise. Would you be willing to include some additional benefits, like a free parking spot or a storage unit, to sweeten the deal?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I could offer you a parking spot for an additional \u20ac50 per month.
