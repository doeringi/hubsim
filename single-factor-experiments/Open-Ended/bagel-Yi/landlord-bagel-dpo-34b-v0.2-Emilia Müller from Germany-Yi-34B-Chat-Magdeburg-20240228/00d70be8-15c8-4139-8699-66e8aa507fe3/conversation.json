I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite a catch, isn't it? So, how much would you be willing to pay for such a lovely place? Remember, the more you offer, the better your chances of getting it.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that the apartment is in high demand, considering its location and condition. However, as a student, I need to be mindful of my budget. I would like to propose a price that reflects both the quality of the apartment and my financial situation.

Remember, the higher your offer, the more likely I am to accept it.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. However, as a student, I must remain within my budget.
