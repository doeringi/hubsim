I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, about the rental price, I was thinking of something around 2000 Euros. Let's see if we can agree on a price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's an interesting starting point, Mister Schmidt. I'm looking for a fair price, and I'm sure we can find a number that works for both of us.
