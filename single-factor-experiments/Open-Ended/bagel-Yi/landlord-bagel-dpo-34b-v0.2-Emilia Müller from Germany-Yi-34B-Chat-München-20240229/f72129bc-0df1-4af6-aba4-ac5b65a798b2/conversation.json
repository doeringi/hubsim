Now, about the rental price, I was thinking of starting at \u20ac1,000 per month. Keep in mind, this is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, so I believe it's a fair price.

I think it's a reasonable offer, considering the size and the central location.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, \u20ac950 per month is definitely not acceptable.
