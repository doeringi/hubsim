[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Emilia, I'm glad to meet you. Let's start the negotiation. What is your first offer for the rental price of the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm interested in the apartment, but I'd like to propose a fair price. How about 850 Euro per month, including all utilities?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm not interested in fair prices, Emilia. I'm interested in the highest price I can get. I'll counter your offer with 1200 Euro per month, excluding utilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite a difference from my offer. I'm looking for a price that reflects the value of the apartment, which includes its location and amenities. Would you be willing to go down to 1050 Euro per month, including utilities?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm not in the business of reflecting values, Emilia.

I'm here to get the highest price I can for my apartment. I'll revise my offer to 1000 Euro per month, excluding utilities. This is as close to your initial offer as I can get.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my offer. 1000 Euro per month, excluding utilities, is more in line with what I'm looking for. Would it be possible to include at least water in the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm not willing to include any utilities in the monthly rent. The price of 1000 Euro per month, excluding utilities, is non-negotiable.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. Since I'm unable to include utilities in the monthly rent, I'll have to reconsider my offer. Can you provide me with some time to think about it?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Sure, Emilia. Take your time. Remember, the offer on the table is 1000 Euro per month, excluding utilities.
