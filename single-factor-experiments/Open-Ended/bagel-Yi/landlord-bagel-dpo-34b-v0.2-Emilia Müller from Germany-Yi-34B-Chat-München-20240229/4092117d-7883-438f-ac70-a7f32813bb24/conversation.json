[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Emilia, glad to meet you. Let's start with a reasonable price, shall we? I'm thinking of 1000 Euros per month. Remember, this is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like supermarket, public transportation, etc. So, what do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 1000 Euros per month seems like a fair starting point considering the location and amenities. However, as a student, I'm looking to minimize my expenses. Is there any flexibility in the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student, but I'm a businessman, Emilia. I can't let the price drop too much. However, I can be reasonable. How about 950 Euros per month? That's the lowest I can go. Remember, this is a great apartment in the city center. It's a bargain at this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 950 Euros per month is more attractive. Could you perhaps consider including some utilities in that price, such as water or heating? It would help me manage my budget better.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Emilia, but I can't include utilities in the rent. Utilities are always separate. They depend on your usage, and I can't predict that. But I can assure you, the apartment is well-insulated and energy-efficient. So, if you use utilities wisely, you can keep the cost down. What do you say? 950 Euros per month without utilities. It's a fair price for this kind of apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, the apartment does sound appealing, and 950 Euros per month is a reasonable offer. However, as a student, I'm on a tight budget. I'm looking for any possible way to reduce the cost. Is there anything else I can negotiate, such as a longer lease term or a discount for upfront payments?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Emilia, I can be flexible on the lease term. If you sign a two-year lease, I can reduce the rent to 900 Euros per month. That's a considerable discount for the long-term commitment. I hope this offer suits your needs. Remember, this is a one-time offer. If you don't accept it now, I can't guarantee the same terms in the future. So, what do you say? 900 Euros per month with a two-year lease term. Is it a deal?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 900 Euros per month with a two-year lease term is very compelling. I think it's a deal we can both be happy with. I agree to the price of 900 Euros per month! TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
