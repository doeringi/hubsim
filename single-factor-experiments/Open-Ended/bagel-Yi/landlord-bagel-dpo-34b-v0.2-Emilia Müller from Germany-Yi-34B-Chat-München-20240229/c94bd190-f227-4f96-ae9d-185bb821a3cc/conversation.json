Remember, this is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like supermarket, public transportation etc. I'm sure you'll find it a great deal for the location and facilities it provides.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, the price you've mentioned is quite high for an unfurnished apartment.

Is there any possibility to negotiate on the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, 1500 Euros per month is too low for this apartment. I'm willing to be flexible, but not to that extent. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How does 1800 Euros per month sound? This is a great apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities. I believe it's a fair price for the value it provides.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 1800 Euros per month is more reasonable, but I'm still hoping to find a lower price.

The apartment is already priced competitively for its location and facilities. However, I could consider a 12-month lease agreement instead of a 15-month one. In that case, I could possibly lower the price to 1750 Euros per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 1750 Euros per month for a 12-month lease is more attractive.

I appreciate your understanding and willingness to negotiate. There's nothing else to add at the moment. The apartment is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center.
