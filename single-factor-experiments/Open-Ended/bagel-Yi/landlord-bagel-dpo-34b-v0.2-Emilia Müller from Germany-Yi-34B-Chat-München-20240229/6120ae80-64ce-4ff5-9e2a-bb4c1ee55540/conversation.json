I must say, it's a real gem in the city center. Now, about the rental price, I was thinking something around 2000 Euros per month. I know it sounds steep, but the location, the facilities, and the new construction are hard to beat. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's an interesting starting point, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate the quality of the apartment, but I'm looking for something more in line with the local market. I'm sure we can find a fair price that reflects the value of the apartment and my budget. How about we start with 1500 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, 1500 Euros is a laughable offer. Do you really think my apartment is worth that little? It's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. I'm sure you understand that this is far below my expectations. Why don't we meet somewhere in the middle, say 1800 Euros? It's a fair price, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I respect your time and effort, but I'm sorry, 1800 Euros is still higher than I'm willing to go. I'm a student, and while I'm smart and responsible, my budget is limited. Let's aim for a more student-friendly price, such as 1200 Euros per month. I believe this is a fair offer considering the location is close to all important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, you're a student, not a fool. 1200 Euros is not even close to what my apartment is worth. You're not the first student I've dealt with, and I know your kind. You're not going to get me to lower my price that much. 1800 Euros is a fair price, and I'm not going to budge. It's a great deal for the location and the quality of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that, Mister Schmidt, and I appreciate your stance. However, as a student, I must be mindful of my expenses. 1800 Euros is simply beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the apartment, but I'm not in a position to overspend.

This would be a reasonable compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, 1400 Euros is still far too low for my apartment.
