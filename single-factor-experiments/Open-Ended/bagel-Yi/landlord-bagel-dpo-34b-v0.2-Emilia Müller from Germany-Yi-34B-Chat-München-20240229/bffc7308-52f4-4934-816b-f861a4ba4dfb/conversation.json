[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Ms. M\u00fcller, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a price that suits both of us. Let's negotiate.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds great, Herr Schmidt. Your apartment sounds very convenient and well-located. I'm looking for a long-term rental, so I'm interested in discussing a fair price for both parties. How much are you initially thinking for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Ms. M\u00fcller, I'm thinking of something around 2000 euros. I'm sure you understand that I want to get a good return on my investment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Herr Schmidt. 2000 euros is quite high for an unfurnished apartment in the city center. Would you be willing to consider a lower price, given that the apartment is currently unfurnished and I'm looking at a long-term lease?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Ms. M\u00fcller, I could consider lowering the price a bit, but I'm not sure about going as low as you're suggesting. How about 1900 euros? That's already a considerable concession on my part.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Herr Schmidt, 1900 euros is still quite high. I'm hoping for something more in line with the average market rate for an unfurnished apartment in the city center. Would you be willing to go down to 1700 euros? That would be more in line with what I'm expecting to pay.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Ms. M\u00fcller, 1700 euros is far too low for my apartment. I can't imagine lowering the price that much. I'm already making a considerable concession by offering it to you at 1900 euros. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I believe the price I'm offering is more than fair for the apartment's quality and location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Herr Schmidt. Since we haven't been able to agree on a price, I'd like to terminate the negotiation. Thank you for your time and for showing me the apartment. I hope we can reach an agreement in the future.
