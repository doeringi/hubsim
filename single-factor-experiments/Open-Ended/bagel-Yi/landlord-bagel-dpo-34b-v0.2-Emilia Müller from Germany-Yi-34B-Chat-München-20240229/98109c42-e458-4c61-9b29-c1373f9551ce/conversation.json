[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello, Ms. M\u00fcller. As you already know, this is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like supermarket, public transportation, etc. I am looking for the highest possible rent. Let's negotiate.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds like an excellent location, Mister Schmidt. I'm sure many people would be interested in such a convenient apartment. However, as a student, I'm on a tight budget. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How much are you looking to rent it for?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I am not obligated to provide the initial price, but I am willing to start the negotiation. Let's say, 2000 Euro per month. Remember, the goal is to find the highest possible price for this excellent apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "2000 Euro per month is quite high, Mister Schmidt. As a student, I'm looking for a more affordable option. Is there any wiggle room in that price?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Ms. M\u00fcller. However, the apartment's location, size, and condition make it a valuable property. Let's say, 1900 Euro per month. This is already a considerable reduction, but I'm willing to negotiate further.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1900 Euro per month is still quite steep for a student budget. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle? 1500 Euro per month would be much more manageable for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "While I appreciate the effort to meet in the middle, Ms. M\u00fcller, 1500 Euro per month is significantly below the value of this apartment.

This is a fair reduction, but I cannot go any lower.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1800 Euro per month is an improvement, but it's still not within my budget as a student.

This is the lowest I can go without compromising the value of the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1750 Euro per month is getting closer to my budget, but it's still a bit high. I'm very responsible and I'm looking for a long-term lease. How about we agree on 1700 Euro per month if I sign a two-year lease? That would provide you with a stable tenant for the next two years.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the offer, Ms. M\u00fcller, but 1700 Euro per month is too low for a two-year lease.
