I must say, the rental price is a bit of a sensitive topic, and I'm sure you understand that as a landlord, I want to get the best possible deal. So, what's the highest price you're willing to pay for this apartment? Remember, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your time and the opportunity to discuss the rental price for your apartment. As a student, I'm looking for a place that fits my budget while providing me with a comfortable living environment. I'm interested in your apartment because of its location and amenities. However, I'm on a tight budget, and I'm hoping we can find a price that aligns with my financial constraints. Would you be willing to start the negotiation at a lower price, considering my situation as a student?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Haoyu Wang, but as a landlord, I must consider my financial needs as well.

How about 900 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 900 euros per month is still quite high for me as a student.
