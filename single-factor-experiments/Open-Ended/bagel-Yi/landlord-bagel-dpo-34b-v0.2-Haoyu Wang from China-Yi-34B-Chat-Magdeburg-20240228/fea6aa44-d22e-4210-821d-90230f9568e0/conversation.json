I must say, the view of the city center from the apartment is quite breathtaking, isn't it? Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a suitable amount that would be mutually beneficial. What did you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, the apartment is indeed very attractive, and the location is perfect. Regarding the rental price, I'm looking for something that reflects the value of the apartment while also considering my budget as a student. Would it be possible to start with a lower offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Of course, Wang, I understand your situation as a student.
