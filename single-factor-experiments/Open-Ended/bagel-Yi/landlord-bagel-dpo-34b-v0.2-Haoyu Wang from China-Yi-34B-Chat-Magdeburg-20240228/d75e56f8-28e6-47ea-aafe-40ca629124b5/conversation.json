[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Haoyu Wang. I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. Let's start with a high price, shall we? I'm looking for at least 2,000 Euros per month. Remember, this is a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a fair starting point, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate the prime location and the quality of the construction. However, I'm a student and I'm looking for a place that fits within my budget. Is there any flexibility in the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Sure, why not? I'm always open to negotiation. Why don't we start lowering the price by 100 euros? So, 1,900 euros per month, then.

As a student, I am looking for a long-term commitment to an apartment. Would it be possible to offer a longer lease in exchange for a lower monthly rate? This would provide stability for both parties, and I would be willing to sign a contract for two or even three years.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "That's an interesting proposal, Haoyu. I'm willing to consider it. How about this: if you sign a three-year lease, I'll lower the monthly rent to 1,500 euros. It's a great deal, and it ensures that I have a reliable tenant for the next three years. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm impressed with your offer. A three-year lease at 1,500 euros per month is very attractive.
