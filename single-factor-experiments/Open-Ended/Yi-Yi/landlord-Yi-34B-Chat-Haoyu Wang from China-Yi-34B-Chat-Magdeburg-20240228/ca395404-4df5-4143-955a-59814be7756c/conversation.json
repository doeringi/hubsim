I'm looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also well-located, and your apartment seems to meet these requirements. Regarding the monthly rent, I'm prepared to pay a fair price that reflects the value of the apartment and its location. Could you please tell me what you're asking for the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Certainly, Haoyu. I believe my apartment offers an excellent balance of quality and convenience, and I'm looking for a tenant who appreciates its value. For the monthly rent, I'm seeking 800 Euros. What do you think of this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for providing the price, Mister Schmidt. 800 Euros is a significant amount, and I would like to discuss if there is any room for negotiation. The apartment is unfurnished, which usually means a lower rent compared to furnished apartments. Additionally, while the location is indeed central and convenient, I'm a student and I need to consider my budget carefully. Could we perhaps discuss a lower price that would be more in line with similar apartments in the area?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your concerns, Haoyu. However, the price of 800 Euros is non-negotiable for several reasons. Firstly, the apartment is brand new and has been recently renovated to a high standard, which adds value. Secondly, the central location provides easy access to public transportation and amenities, which is a significant advantage. Finally, the demand for quality housing in Magdeburg is high, especially in the city center, and I believe this price reflects the market value. If you're unable to meet this price, I'm sorry, but I'm looking for a tenant who can appreciate the full value of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your time and effort in showing me the apartment, Mister Schmidt. However, I must be honest with you. As a student, I have a limited budget, and 800 Euros per month is beyond what I can afford. I'm sorry to say that I cannot accept your offer at this price. I hope you understand my situation.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Haoyu, and I appreciate your honesty. Since the price is non-negotiable, I respect your decision to look for an apartment that fits within your budget. If you find that a different apartment better suits your needs, I encourage you to consider other options. I wish you the best of luck in your search.
