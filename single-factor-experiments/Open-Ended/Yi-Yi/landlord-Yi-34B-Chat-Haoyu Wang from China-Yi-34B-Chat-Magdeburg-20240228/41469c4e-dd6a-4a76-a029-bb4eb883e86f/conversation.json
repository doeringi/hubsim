I believe the market rate for a newly built, unfurnished apartment of this size in the city center is quite high, especially given its proximity to essential amenities. However, as a landlord, I am always looking for a fair deal. So, let's say I'm willing to start at \u20ac1,200 per month.

The apartment does offer a lot of value, and I appreciate the amenities and location. However, I am a student and need to consider my budget carefully.

Would you be willing to accept this revised offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Haoyu, as a landlord, I am willing to work with you. However, I must stress that \u20ac1,150 per month is still below the market rate for such an apartment. Nonetheless, considering your student status and the potential long-term benefit of having a reliable tenant, I am willing to accept your offer. I agree to the price of \u20ac1,150 Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm very grateful for your understanding and generosity, Mister Schmidt.
