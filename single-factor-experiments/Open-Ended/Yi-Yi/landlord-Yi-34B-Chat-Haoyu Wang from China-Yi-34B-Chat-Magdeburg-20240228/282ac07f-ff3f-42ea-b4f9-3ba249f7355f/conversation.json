[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. Regarding the rental price, I'm open to offers. What did you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your hospitality. As a student, I'm looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also affordable. The apartment seems to fit my needs perfectly. I'm hoping we can reach a fair agreement on the price.

I would like to start with an asking price of 750 Euro per month. Is this within your budget?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your asking price is quite high for a student like me. I was hoping for something more in the range of 500 Euro per month, considering the apartment is unfurnished and I would need to provide my own furniture. Is there any wiggle room in your price?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "While I appreciate your situation as a student, I must maintain a fair market value for my property. 750 Euro per month is a competitive price for a newly built apartment in the city center.

Since you've made your final offer, I'll counter with a price that I believe is fair for both parties. How does 637 Euro per month sound to you? This is as low as I can go and still feel that I'm offering a competitive rate for the apartment. If you agree to this, we can proceed with the lease.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your counteroffer of 637 Euro per month is very close to my budget.
