Could you tell me what your initial offer is?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I don't believe in giving away my best price right away. I prefer to negotiate and find a price that is acceptable to both parties. What is your budget for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your approach, Mister Schmidt. My budget for the rent is quite flexible, but I'm hoping to find the best deal possible. Would you be willing to start with a lower offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Certainly, I'm open to negotiations.
