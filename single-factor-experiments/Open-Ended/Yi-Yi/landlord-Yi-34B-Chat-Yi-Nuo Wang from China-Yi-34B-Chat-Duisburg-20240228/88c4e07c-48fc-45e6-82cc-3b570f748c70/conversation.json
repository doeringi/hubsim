[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Yi-Nuo Wang. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you will find my apartment quite satisfactory. Let's discuss the rental price. What's your budget?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm a student, so my budget is quite limited. However, I'm smart and responsible, and I always follow moral and ethical standards. I want to be on good terms with my landlord. Your apartment, being a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom in the city center, is quite appealing, especially since it's close to all important facilities. Could you offer me a price that reflects my situation as a student?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Yi-Nuo, I understand that you're a student and may have a limited budget. However, my apartment is in high demand due to its prime location and modern amenities. As a landlord, I need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for my investment. Would you be able to offer me a price that shows me you're serious about renting the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm very serious about renting your apartment. It's perfect for me, and I'm sure we can find a price that is fair for both of us. How about 500 Euro per month? I think that's a reasonable offer, considering my status as a student and the fact that the apartment is unfurnished.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Yi-Nuo, your offer of 500 Euro per month is not acceptable. The location and the recent construction of the apartment command a higher price. I'm looking for a tenant who appreciates the value of this property and is willing to pay accordingly. If you're serious about renting this apartment, I suggest you reconsider your offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. The apartment is indeed of high value, and I'm willing to pay a fair price. Would you consider 550 Euro per month? This is the highest I can afford right now, and I believe it reflects the balance of what you're offering and what I can pay as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Yi-Nuo, your offer of 550 Euro per month is still below the market value for such an apartment. I'm sorry, but I cannot accept it. If you're truly interested in renting this apartment, I suggest you discuss with your financial backers or consider finding a roommate to help with the costs.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your time and the quality of your apartment. However, as a student, I don't have financial backers, and finding a roommate is not an option I'm considering at the moment. I'm willing to pay 575 Euro per month, which I believe is a fair price for both parties. This is my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Yi-Nuo, your final offer of 575 Euro per month is still not sufficient for the apartment. I'm sorry, but I cannot accept it. The apartment is worth more than what you're offering. If you're unable to meet the market value, I suggest you look for other options.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry to hear that, Mister Schmidt. I've made my final offer of 575 Euro per month, and I believe it's a fair price considering my situation as a student and the condition of the apartment. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to look for other options.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Yi-Nuo, it seems we have reached an impasse. I'm sorry, but I cannot accept your offer of 575 Euro per month. The apartment is worth more than that, and I'm looking for a tenant who is willing to pay its true value. If you're unable to meet the market price, I suggest you continue your search elsewhere.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. Since we cannot agree on a price, I will respectfully terminate the negotiation and continue my search for an apartment. I hope you find a tenant who can meet your expectations for the apartment.
