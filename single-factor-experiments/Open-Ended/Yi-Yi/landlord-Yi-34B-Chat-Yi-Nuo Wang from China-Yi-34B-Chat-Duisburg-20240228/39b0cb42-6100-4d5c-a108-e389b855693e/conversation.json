Could you tell me what the initial asking price is?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Of course, Yi-Nuo. I'm looking to get the best deal for both of us. The initial asking price for the apartment is \u20ac800 per month. What do you think about this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the apartment is indeed well-located and newly built, I believe there's room for discussion on the price. Could we perhaps start with a lower offer and work from there?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Certainly, Yi-Nuo. I'm open to considering a lower offer.

What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Your offer of \u20ac765 is closer to my initial asking price, but I still believe \u20ac775 is a fair price for the apartment.

What's your final decision on the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I'm not willing to pay more than \u20ac765 per month. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to look for other options.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Yi-Nuo. Since you're not willing to pay more than \u20ac765, and I'm not willing to accept less than \u20ac775, it seems we have reached an impasse. I appreciate your time, but I must respectfully decline your offer. I wish you the best of luck in your search for a suitable apartment.
