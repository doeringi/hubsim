I'm sure you will find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much are you willing to pay for a monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Herr Schmidt. I'm looking for a monthly rent that is within my budget and reflects the value of the apartment. Could you tell me what the initial asking price is?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Certainly, M\u00fcller. I initially planned to ask for 750 Euros per month. However, I am open to negotiations. What do you think is a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Herr Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

The location and amenities are definitely a plus. However, I'm still seeking a price that aligns with my budget.

This would be a more competitive rate considering the unfurnished status of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "M\u00fcller, your request for 680 Euros per month is still lower than what I believe the apartment is worth. However, I am willing to be flexible for a tenant who appreciates the value of this prime location. Let's settle at 695 Euros per month. This is my final offer. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Herr Schmidt, your persistence is commendable.
