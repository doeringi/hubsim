I'm sure you'll find this apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs. How much were you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I believe that the market value for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment of this size in the city center is around 750 Euro per month. However, I'm open to negotiation, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to lower the rent, perhaps to 700 Euro?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, you have an excellent sense of the market value. However, as a landlord, I'm always looking to get the best deal for my property. I'm willing to go as low as 725 Euro per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 725 Euro is quite reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must be honest with you. My budget for this apartment is a bit tighter, and I was hoping to find a price closer to 650 Euro.

I'm not sure if I can accommodate that request. How about we meet in the middle at 700 Euro? I believe this is a fair price given the location and the amenities of the apartment. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 700 Euro is very fair, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I must discuss this with my family and make a decision soon. Could you give me until tomorrow to let you know if we can agree on this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Certainly, Emilia. I understand that making such a decision requires careful consideration. You have until tomorrow to let me know your final decision.
