I'm looking for a fair price for this newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities, which is a huge plus. I'm a student, and I'm known for being smart, dependable, and responsible. I don't like to be tricked, and I always follow moral and ethical standards. I'd like to maintain a good relationship with my landlord, so I'm here to negotiate the best price for both of us. What's the lowest price you'd be willing to offer for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I appreciate your straightforwardness and your commitment to ethics.

I'm looking to pay a fair price for the apartment, considering its features and the amenities it offers. Since you mentioned that you're willing to negotiate, I would like to propose an initial offer of \u20ac650 per month. This amount seems reasonable to me, considering the size, location, and the fact that it's unfurnished. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, your offer of \u20ac650 per month is quite low for an apartment of this quality and location. However, I'm willing to consider it, as you seem like a responsible tenant. Could you perhaps increase your offer slightly to reflect the value of the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to consider my offer, Mister Schmidt. I understand that the apartment is of high quality and in a prime location. However, as a student, I need to balance the quality of my living space with my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as \u20ac700 per month? This would be a more manageable amount for me, and I would be a very conscientious tenant.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, \u20ac700 per month is still below the market value for this apartment. However, considering your responsible nature and the fact that you're a student, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet halfway at \u20ac750 per month? This would be a fair compromise, in my opinion. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. \u20ac750 per month is indeed a fair compromise, and I'm willing to agree to this price.
