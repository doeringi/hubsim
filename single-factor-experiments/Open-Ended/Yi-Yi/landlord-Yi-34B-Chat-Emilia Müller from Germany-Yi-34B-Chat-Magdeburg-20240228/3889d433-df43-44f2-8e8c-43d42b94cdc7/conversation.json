I'm sure you'll find it quite attractive, especially with its central location and modern amenities. How much were you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm interested in the apartment, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement that suits both of us. Would you be willing to start the negotiations at a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I'm open to negotiations, but I must stress that this apartment is in high demand due to its excellent location and recent construction. I'm looking to secure a fair market price, which I believe reflects the quality of the property. Would you be willing to start the bidding at a higher rate?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I understand that you're offering a desirable property. However, I'm a student, and I'm looking to balance quality with affordability.

This would be a fair price for the size and location of the apartment, considering my student status. Would you be open to this initial offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, your offer of 550 Euro per month is quite low for the apartment's location and condition. While I understand your budget constraints as a student, I must insist on a price that reflects the property's value.

Would you be willing to meet me at this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While 700 Euro per month is a fair price, it's still beyond my budget as a student. I'm looking for a place that won't strain my finances too much. How about we find a middle ground? I could offer 675 Euro per month, which would be a significant increase from my initial offer and reflects the value of the apartment. Would you consider this a fair compromise?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, your offer of 675 Euro per month is getting closer to my asking price. However, I must insist on 700 Euro per month to ensure a fair deal for both of us. This amount would provide you with a great living space in the city center, while also allowing me to cover my costs and earn a fair profit. If you are unable to meet this price, I may have to reconsider our negotiations.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm sorry, but 700 Euro per month is still out of my budget.
