The apartment seems to be in an excellent location, and the size is just right for me. I'm looking to rent for the long term, so I'd like to propose a fair price that reflects both the quality of the apartment and the current market conditions. Would you be open to discussing a range of prices?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Certainly, Max. I'm always open to fair negotiations.

I'm aware that the location and quality of the apartment are quite attractive. I would like to propose a starting point of 900 Euros per month for the rental price.
