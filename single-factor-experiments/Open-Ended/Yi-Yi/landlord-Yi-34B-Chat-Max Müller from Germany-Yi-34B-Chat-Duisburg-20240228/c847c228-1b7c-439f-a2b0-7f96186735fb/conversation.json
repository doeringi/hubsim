I'm impressed by the location and the amenities. Regarding the price, I'm looking to pay around 750 Euros per month, including all utilities, for a place like this. I believe this reflects a fair value considering the market rates in the area and the features of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, your offer of 750 Euros per month, including utilities, is certainly a starting point for negotiation. However, considering the prime location, the modern amenities, and the fact that it's a new construction, I believe the value of the apartment is higher. I would like to propose 900 Euros per month, which I believe is a fair price for both parties. What are your thoughts on this?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your counteroffer of 900 Euros per month is significantly higher than my initial expectation. While I appreciate the quality and location of the apartment, I must remain within my budget as a student. Could we find a middle ground between our offers? Perhaps we could negotiate a price closer to 800 Euros per month, which would still be a competitive rate for the area, considering my long-term commitment as a tenant.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, your budget of 800 Euros per month is a reasonable request. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer 850 Euros per month, including all utilities. This rate reflects the high demand for apartments in this area and the quality of the building. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account both your needs as a student and the value of the property. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 850 Euros per month, including utilities, is a more acceptable proposition. It aligns better with my budget and the value I see in the apartment. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could we discuss the terms of the lease as well? For example, is there any flexibility in the lease term, and are there any additional fees I should be aware of?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Glad to hear that you find the offer more acceptable, Max. Regarding the lease terms, we typically offer a 12-month lease, but I'm open to discussing shorter or longer terms if that better suits your situation. There are no additional fees beyond the monthly rent; all utilities are included in the price, and there's no hidden cost. The only thing to consider is a small security deposit, which is equivalent to one month's rent, to protect the property in case of any damages. This deposit will be refunded to you at the end of your tenancy provided there are no outstanding issues. Does this arrangement sound acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Yes, Mister Schmidt, the lease terms you've described are very reasonable.
