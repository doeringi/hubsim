Since you seem like a serious tenant, I'll make you an offer. If you can pay \u20ac865 up front, I'll waive the security deposit. That's a significant savings for you, and it shows good faith on your part. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Waiving the security deposit is a very generous offer, and it does make \u20ac865 seem more attractive.

Thank you for your time and this agreement, Mister Schmidt.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm glad we could come to an agreement, Max.
