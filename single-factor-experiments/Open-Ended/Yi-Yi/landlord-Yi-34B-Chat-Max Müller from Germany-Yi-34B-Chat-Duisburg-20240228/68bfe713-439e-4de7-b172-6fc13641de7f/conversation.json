I'm sure you'll find it to be a great place to live, being so centrally located with all the amenities you need nearby.

I believe the market value for a newly built, unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in the city center is around 800 Euro per month. However, I am a student and I'm looking to negotiate the best price possible. I'm smart, dependable, and responsible, and I always follow moral and ethical standards. I'm also keen to maintain a good relationship with my landlord. Could we possibly start at 750 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I appreciate your honesty and your approach to negotiations. While 750 Euro may be a fair price for an apartment of this size and location, I must confess that I am looking to maximize the rent for this property. It's a new construction, and I believe the market can bear a higher price. How does 900 Euro sound to you? It's a fair reflection of the value of the apartment, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal for such a prime location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I understand your perspective. However, as a student, I'm on a tight budget, and I'm looking to secure the best deal possible. 900 Euro per month is quite steep for me. Could we perhaps find a middle ground?

I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the market value and my financial situation.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. 825 Euro does sound like a reasonable compromise. However, as a landlord, I'm always looking to get the best deal for my property. Would you be willing to go just a bit higher, say 850 Euro per month? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the prime location and amenities. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, you make a compelling argument. I'm willing to come up to 850 Euro per month, as it's a fair reflection of the apartment's value and my budget can stretch that far. I believe this is a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you be willing to accept 850 Euro per month as the rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I'm glad to hear that you're willing to meet me at 850 Euro per month. This is indeed a fair price for both parties. I agree to the price of 850 Euro! Let's proceed with the lease agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Wonderful news, Mister Schmidt! I'm very pleased to have reached an agreement with you.
