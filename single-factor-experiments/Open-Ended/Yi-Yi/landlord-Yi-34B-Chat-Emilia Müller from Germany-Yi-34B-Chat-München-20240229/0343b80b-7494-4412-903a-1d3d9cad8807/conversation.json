[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be in an excellent location, with all the amenities you could need nearby. How much were you thinking of offering for the rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your time, Mister Schmidt. I'm impressed by the quality of this newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all the important facilities, which is a big plus for me. I'm looking to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible, so I'll start with an offer of 800 Euro per month. Is that a price we can work with?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 800 Euro per month is much lower than my expectations. This apartment is in high demand due to its prime location and modern amenities. I'm looking for a price that reflects the true value of the property. How about we start at 1200 Euro per month? I believe this is a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1200 Euro per month is quite high for an unfurnished apartment, Mister Schmidt. While I understand the demand for such a location, I'm a student and need to consider my budget. Could we possibly meet in the middle? How about 1000 Euro per month? This would be more in line with what I can afford while still recognizing the value of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "1000 Euro per month is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still not convinced it reflects the true value of the property. The location alone warrants a higher price. How about we compromise at 1100 Euro per month? This would be a fair deal for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 1100 Euro per month is more acceptable, and it's a price I'm willing to consider. However, I would like to have a few additional amenities included to make the apartment more comfortable for me as a student. Would you be willing to provide some basic furniture, such as a bed and a desk? This would help me save on additional costs.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I'm unable to provide any furniture as the apartment is currently unfurnished. However, I'm willing to consider your offer of 1100 Euro per month if you can sign a one-year lease agreement. This would provide me with the stability I'm looking for in a tenant. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "A one-year lease agreement is a commitment I'm willing to make if the price is right, Mister Schmidt. With the additional savings from not having to buy furniture, 1100 Euro per month is a price I can agree to. However, I would like to have the option to terminate the lease with a month's notice if my circumstances change unexpectedly. Would that be possible?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot agree to a termination with just a month's notice. A one-year lease is standard in the industry, and it's what I require to secure the apartment. However, I'm willing to offer you a two-week grace period in case of emergency, during which you can terminate the lease without penalty. Does this meet your needs?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "A two-week grace period is a reasonable compromise, Mister Schmidt. With that in place, I'm happy to agree to the one-year lease at 1100 Euro per month. I appreciate your flexibility on this matter.
