I'm sure you'll find my apartment to be a great place to live. How much are you willing to pay for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your confidence, Herr Schmidt. I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the value of the apartment. Would you be willing to start at a lower rate, considering it's unfurnished and I'll be providing all the furniture and decorations myself?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Of course, Emilia. I understand that you will be furnishing the apartment. How much lower would you like to start? Remember, the location is prime, and the apartment is brand new.
