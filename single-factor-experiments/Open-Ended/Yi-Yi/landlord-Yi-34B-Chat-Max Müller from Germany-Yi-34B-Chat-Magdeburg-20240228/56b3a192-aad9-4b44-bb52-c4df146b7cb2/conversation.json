I'm sure you'll find my apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs. How much were you thinking of paying per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your apartment seems to be quite attractive with its central location and modern amenities. However, I'm a student and I'm looking for a reasonable price that fits within my budget. Could we start with a figure around 600 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "600 Euros per month is indeed a reasonable starting point, Max. However, considering the prime location and the recent construction of the apartment, I was hoping for a little bit more. How does 700 Euros sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "700 Euros per month is quite steep for a student like me. While the location and quality of the apartment are appealing, I'm looking to strike a balance between quality and affordability.

I can offer you a fixed rate for utilities, which will not exceed 100 Euros per month. Additionally, if you are willing to commit to a two-year lease, I can provide you with one month of free rent. This would bring the effective monthly cost down to 633.33 Euros, which I believe is quite competitive for the market. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's an excellent offer, Mister Schmidt. The fixed rate for utilities and the free month of rent make the overall package very attractive. I'm happy to agree to a two-year lease to secure these benefits. I agree to the price of 650 Euros per month, including the fixed utilities rate and the one month of free rent for a two-year lease.
