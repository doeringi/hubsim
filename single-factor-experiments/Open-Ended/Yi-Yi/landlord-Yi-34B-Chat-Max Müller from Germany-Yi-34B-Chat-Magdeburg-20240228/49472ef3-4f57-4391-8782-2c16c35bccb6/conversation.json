As the landlord, I'm always looking to strike a balance that is fair for both parties. The location of this apartment is prime, and I'm confident in the value it offers.

Are you open to going a bit higher?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm willing to negotiate, but I must remain within a reasonable range.

How about 800 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your counter-offer of 800 Euro per month is very close to my budget limit. I'm willing to pay a premium for the apartment, but I must ensure that I can afford the long-term commitment.

However, I must emphasize that this apartment is a rare find in the city center, and the price is already highly competitive considering the current market trends. I'm not in a position to offer significant discounts or incentives. Nevertheless, I'm willing to consider a small concession if it helps seal the deal. How does 825 Euro per month sound to you?
