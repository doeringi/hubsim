I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much were you thinking of paying per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for the opportunity, Mr. Schmidt. I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the quality of the apartment and the amenities it offers. Since it's newly built and in the city center, I believe it's a prime location. Could you tell me your asking price?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Of course, Mr. Abbasi. I'm looking to get the best deal for my property.

This would be a fair compromise, I think.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your consideration is appreciated, Mr. Schmidt.
