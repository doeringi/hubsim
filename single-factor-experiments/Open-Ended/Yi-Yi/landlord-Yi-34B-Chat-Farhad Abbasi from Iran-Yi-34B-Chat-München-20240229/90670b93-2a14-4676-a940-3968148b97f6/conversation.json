[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

I'm sure you will find this apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs. How much are you willing to pay for such a prime location in the city center?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm interested in the apartment, but I'm a student, so I'm looking for a fair price. Can you tell me what the lowest price would be for this unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I always aim to provide the best living space for my tenants. However, I must also ensure that I receive a fair price that reflects the quality and location of the apartment. What is your highest price you would consider paying for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As a student, I'm on a budget, so I'm looking for the lowest price possible. I'm smart and responsible, and I'm not easily tricked. I'm willing to negotiate, but I want to be on good terms with my landlord. What's the lowest price you can offer for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Abbasi. As a landlord, I'm willing to work with you to find a price that is fair for both parties. Let's start with a figure that I believe is reasonable for this apartment in the city center: 800 Euro per month. This includes all utilities except for electricity, which we will discuss separately. What do you think of this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "800 Euro per month seems like a lot for a student like me. I'm looking for something much lower, considering the unfurnished state of the apartment. Could you offer something more in line with my budget?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand that as a student, you have budget constraints. However, the location of this apartment is very central, which usually comes with a higher price tag. Nevertheless, I'm willing to negotiate.

I would like to pay no more than 550 Euro per month, including all utilities. This is the maximum I can afford. Could we find a middle ground between 550 Euro and 800 Euro?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Mr. Abbasi, your budget is significantly lower than the price I initially offered. While I respect your financial situation as a student, I must also cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about 650 Euro per month, including all utilities except for electricity? This would be a fair compromise, in my opinion. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "650 Euro per month is still quite high for me, considering the unfurnished state of the apartment.

I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this rental. How about we meet in the middle at 625 Euro per month, including all utilities except for electricity? This would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "625 Euro per month is more acceptable, considering the location and the size of the apartment.

I can offer you the apartment for 625 Euro per month, excluding electricity. This way, you have control over your electricity usage, and I can ensure that my costs are not exceeding my income. Would you be willing to accept this offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understanding your concerns, I agree to the price of 625 Euro per month, excluding electricity.
