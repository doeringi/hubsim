Could you tell me what your initial asking price is?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Of course, Emilia. I believe the market value for an apartment of this quality and location is quite high. My initial asking price is 1,200 euros per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's an interesting starting point.

While the location and amenities are excellent, the apartment is unfurnished, which means I'll have to invest in furniture. Additionally, the building is newly built, which means there's no established reputation for the apartment complex yet. These factors, combined with my budget constraints, lead me to believe that 1,000 euros per month is a fair offer. What is your counter-offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your points, Emilia. As a landlord, I need to ensure that the rent reflects the value of the property. A fair price considering all factors would be 1,100 euros per month. This is still lower than my initial offer and takes into account the unfurnished state and the newness of the building. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your counter-offer of 1,100 euros per month is more aligned with what I had in mind. It's a good compromise considering the apartment's location and condition. I'm willing to accept this price. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
