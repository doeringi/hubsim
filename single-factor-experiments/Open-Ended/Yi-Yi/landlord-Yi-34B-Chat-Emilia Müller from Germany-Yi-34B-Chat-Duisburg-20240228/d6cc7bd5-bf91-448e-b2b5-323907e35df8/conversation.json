[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

I am sure we can come to an agreement that suits both our needs. How much were you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you are the landlord and have a certain price in mind for your newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. I am a student and am looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also affordable. I am smart, dependable, and responsible, and I always follow moral and ethical standards. I would like to be on good terms with my landlord, which is why I am looking to negotiate a fair price for both parties. My goal is to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible, while still being fair to you as the landlord. How can we work together to find a price that we are both satisfied with?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your honesty, Ms. M\u00fcller. I appreciate your approach to negotiation. As a landlord, I do have a certain price in mind that I believe reflects the value of the apartment, its location, and the current market rates. However, I am open to considering your financial situation as a student and finding a price that is fair to both of us. Would you like to make an initial offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my situation as a student. I understand that you have a price in mind, and I am willing to work with you to find a fair compromise. I would like to propose a starting price of 800 Euros per month, which I believe is a reasonable amount considering the size and location of the apartment. I am open to discussing any additional fees or requirements as well. What do you think about this initial offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Ms. M\u00fcller, your offer of 800 Euros per month is quite low for the location and standard of the apartment. While I appreciate your effort to negotiate, I must be honest with you. The market rate for similar apartments in the city center is significantly higher. However, I am willing to work with you since you seem like a responsible tenant. How about we start at 1,200 Euros per month, which is a fair price given the current market and the amenities provided? We can discuss any additional fees or requirements later. What are your thoughts on this counter-offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your counter-offer, Mister Schmidt. I understand that 1,200 Euros per month is more in line with the market rate, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. As a student, this amount is still quite high for my budget, but I am willing to consider it. Before we proceed, could you please tell me about any additional fees or requirements that I should be aware of?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Certainly, Ms. M\u00fcller. There are a few additional costs and requirements that come with renting the apartment. Firstly, there is a one-time administrative fee of 200 Euros, which covers the cost of setting up the rental agreement and any associated paperwork. Additionally, I require a three-month security deposit, which is fully refundable upon move-out provided there is no damage to the property and all utilities are paid in full.\n\nRegarding utilities, the tenant is responsible for electricity and internet. I can provide a list of recommended providers if you need. Also, there is a strict no-pet policy, as I want to maintain the condition of the apartment for future tenants.\n\nNow, regarding the rent, I am willing to negotiate a slight decrease from my initial offer of 1,200 Euros per month. How about we settle at 1,100 Euros per month, including all other costs? This would be a fair deal for both parties, considering your financial situation and the value of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the information you've provided regarding additional fees and requirements.

There will be no additional charges unless there is damage to the property or unpaid utilities.\n\nI agree to the price of 1,100 Euros per month!

This will ensure that there are no misunderstandings about the apartment's condition upon move-out.\n\nShall we set a date for the walk-through and to sign the rental agreement?
