I appreciate your time and effort in showing me the apartment. It's exactly what I'm looking for. As for the price, I was hoping for something in the range of 700 Euros per month, all-inclusive. Is that something we could work with?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, 700 Euros per month is a bit below my expectations.

How about we start at 800 Euros per month, and see if we can find a middle ground that satisfies both of us?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Herr Schmidt, 800 Euros is quite high for an unfurnished apartment in the city center. I understand that you might have your expectations, but considering the current market and the fact that the apartment is unfurnished, I would like to propose 750 Euros per month. This would be a fair price for both parties, I believe. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, 750 Euros is still below what I'm looking for.

Let's focus on the rent for now. Since the apartment is unfurnished, could we meet in the middle and say 775 Euros per month? This would be a fair compromise, I think. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, 775 Euros is closer to what I had in mind. However, considering the terms you're offering, I think I can agree to 775 Euros per month with a standard deposit and a one-year lease.

I'm happy to agree to 775 Euros per month with a standard deposit and a one-year lease.
