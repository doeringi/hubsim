I would consider a rent of 1000 Euro per month to be a fair price for this apartment. It's a great location and a brand new building, so I think it's a reasonable offer. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the offer, but as a student, I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to lower the price a bit? Maybe we can find a more student-friendly rate.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that as a student, you may have budget constraints. However, the location and quality of the apartment are quite desirable, which is why I've priced it at 1000 Euros per month.

The location and quality are indeed very attractive. How about 900 Euros per month? I think that would be a fair compromise given my student status.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "900 Euros per month is still not a price that reflects the value of this apartment. I'm sorry, but I cannot accept that. If you're unable to pay the fair market price of 1000 Euros, I suggest we end the negotiation here.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, and I appreciate the time you've spent with me. However, I'm also on a tight budget as a student. If we cannot find a price that works for both of us, then perhaps it's best to look for another apartment that better fits my financial situation. Thank you for your time, and I hope we can part on good terms.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "You're welcome, Max.
