With the two-year lease, you'll enjoy the fixed rate of 825 Euros per month, with no hidden costs for utilities or maintenance. The cleaning fee upon move-out will still apply, but you'll have the peace of mind of a stable rent for the duration of the lease. Is this offer acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 825 Euros per month with a two-year lease is very appealing.
