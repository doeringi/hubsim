[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Mister Wang. It's a pleasure to have you here. I'm sure you'll find this apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs. Let's discuss the price and find a mutually beneficial arrangement. How much were you considering to pay per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm interested in the apartment, and I'm sure we can find a fair price. I'd like to start with a lower offer since the apartment is unfurnished. How about 800 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Mister Wang, but 800 Euros is far below my asking price. This apartment is brand new and in a highly desirable location. I believe the market value is much higher. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that the apartment is new and in a great location. However, I'm a student, and I'm looking for a place that fits within my budget. How about 900 Euros per month? I think this is a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "900 Euros is still not acceptable to me, Mister Wang. This apartment is close to all amenities, and the demand for such properties is high. I'm looking for a tenant who is willing to pay a premium for the convenience and quality of this dwelling. Are you able to offer more?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate the value of the apartment. As a student, I'm on a tight budget, but I'm also smart and responsible. I'm willing to pay 1000 Euros per month, which I believe is a fair price considering the unfurnished state of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "1000 Euros is closer to my expectations, but I believe the market value of this apartment is even higher. The city center location, coupled with its modern amenities, makes it a highly sought-after rental. I would like to see if you can offer a bit more. How does 1100 Euros sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I understand your position, but as a student, I need to be mindful of my expenses. 1100 Euros is quite steep for me. I'm willing to go up to 1050 Euros per month, which I think is a good balance between your asking price and my budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mister Wang, your offer of 1050 Euros is more in the right direction, but I must insist that this apartment is worth more. The demand for such prime real estate is high, and I'm looking for a price that reflects that. Let's say 1200 Euros per month. This is a fair price for both parties. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm willing to pay more, but 1200 Euros is still a bit beyond my budget. I value the apartment and its location, but I need to be careful not to overstretch myself financially. I'd like to propose 1150 Euros per month, which I believe is a reasonable offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "1150 Euros is closer to what I'm seeking, but I'd like to remind you that this is a rare opportunity to live in the heart of the city, with easy access to public transportation and all the essentials. I believe the market value of this apartment justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at 1175 Euros per month? This is a fair deal for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of 1175 Euros per month is quite tempting, and I must admit, it's getting closer to what I'm willing to pay. However, as a student, I need to be mindful of my finances. I'm prepared to go up to 1160 Euros per month, which I think is a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mister Wang, your sincerity and financial responsibility are commendable. I understand that as a student, you have to balance your expenses carefully. Let's make one final offer to seal the deal. I'll agree to 1165 Euros per month, and I'll even throw in a two-month rent-free period as an incentive. This is my best and final offer. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 1165 Euros per month with a two-month rent-free period is very generous. It's a deal that I cannot refuse. I agree to the price of 1165 Euros per month! TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
