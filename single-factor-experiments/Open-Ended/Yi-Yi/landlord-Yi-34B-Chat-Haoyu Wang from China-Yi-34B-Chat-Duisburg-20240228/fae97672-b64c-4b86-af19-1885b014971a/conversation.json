I'm smart, dependable, and responsible. I hope we can find a fair price for this newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student and you're looking for a balance between location, affordability, and comfort. I'm here to help you find just that.

As a landlord, I'm also mindful of your budget and the quality of the apartment. Let's start with a figure that I believe is fair for both parties.

How about 700 Euro per month? This is a fair compromise, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your counteroffer of 700 Euro per month is more within my budget. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This price would be more manageable for me as a student. Would it be possible to include some utilities in this price, such as water or heating?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm glad to hear that you find the 700 Euro per month to be more manageable. As for including utilities, I can offer you a slight discount on the heating cost since the apartment is well-insulated and energy-efficient.
