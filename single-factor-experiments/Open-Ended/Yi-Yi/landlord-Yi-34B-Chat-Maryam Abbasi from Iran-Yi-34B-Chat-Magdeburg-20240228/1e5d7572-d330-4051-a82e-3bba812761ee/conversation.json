I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs.

I'm smart and I don't want to be tricked. I'm also very responsible and I follow moral and ethical standards. I'd like to be on good terms with my landlord, so I'd appreciate a reasonable offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concerns, Maryam. As a landlord, I value honesty and fairness. I'm not looking to trick anyone, and I'm open to a reasonable offer that reflects the quality and location of the apartment.

I've done some research, and considering the location and the size of the apartment, I think 600 Euros per month would be a fair price.

The apartment is brand new, with modern amenities and a high-quality finish. It features a fully equipped kitchen with stainless steel appliances, a spacious living room with plenty of natural light, and a large bedroom with a built-in wardrobe. The bathroom has both a bathtub and a separate shower. Additionally, the apartment building has a fitness center, a communal garden, and a secure parking lot. The location is prime, with easy access to public transportation, shopping centers, and cultural attractions. All these factors contribute to the value of the apartment, and I believe a rent of 750 Euros per month would be more in line with its market value. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your description sounds like the apartment is quite luxurious. 750 Euros per month is more than I can afford as a student.

Is there any wiggle room for a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your situation as a student, Maryam, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle? If you can offer 700 Euros per month, I think we can reach an agreement.
