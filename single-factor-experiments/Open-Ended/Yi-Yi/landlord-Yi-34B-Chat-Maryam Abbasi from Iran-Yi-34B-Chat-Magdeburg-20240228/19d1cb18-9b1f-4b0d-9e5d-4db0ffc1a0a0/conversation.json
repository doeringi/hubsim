Could you provide me with your initial asking price so that we can work from there?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Certainly, Maryam. I initially had in mind a rate of 800 Euros per month. However, I'm open to considering any offer you might have. Would you like to make one?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your initial asking price is quite high, Mister Schmidt.

Could we negotiate a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Absolutely, Maryam. I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How much lower would you like to negotiate? Perhaps we can find a middle ground that satisfies both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I would like to propose 700 Euros per month, Mister Schmidt.

Would you be willing to meet at this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Your offer is closer to my expectations, Maryam.
