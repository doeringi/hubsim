Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much are you willing to pay for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the value of the apartment.

What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, meeting halfway at \u20ac875 would be a good compromise.
