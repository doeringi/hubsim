As a landlord, I always strive to provide the best living experience for my tenants. However, I must also ensure that I'm getting a fair price for my property.

While it may be below my initial expectations, I'm willing to consider it given your student status and your apparent willingness to negotiate. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? Perhaps 900 Euros per month would be more equitable?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your counter-offer of 900 Euros per month is a fair compromise. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. This price would be more manageable for me, considering my budget as a student.
