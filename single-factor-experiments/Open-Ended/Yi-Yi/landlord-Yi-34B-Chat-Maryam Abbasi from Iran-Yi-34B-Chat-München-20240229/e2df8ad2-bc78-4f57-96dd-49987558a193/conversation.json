As a student, I'm looking for a place that's not only functional but also affordable. What's the lowest price you're willing to offer for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, as a landlord, I'm always looking to provide the best living experience for my tenants.
