I'm sure you will find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient. How much were you thinking of offering for the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm interested in your apartment and I'm looking to negotiate a fair price. Can you tell me what the initial asking price is?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Yi-Nuo, I'm open to negotiations. However, I believe that the quality of the apartment speaks for itself. It's a brand-new construction in the heart of the city, with all the amenities you could ask for. I'm sure you'll appreciate the location and the modern design. What is your budget for monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm ready to make a competitive offer for your apartment. Can you please provide me with the initial asking price so I can work from there?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Yi-Nuo, I understand that you're interested in negotiating a fair price. However, I prefer to work on an offer that meets both our needs. Would you be able to tell me what your budget is for monthly rent?
