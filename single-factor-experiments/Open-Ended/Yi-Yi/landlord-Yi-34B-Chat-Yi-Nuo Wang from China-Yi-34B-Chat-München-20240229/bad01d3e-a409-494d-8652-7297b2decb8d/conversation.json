I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. As for the rental price, I'm open to discussing a fair market value that reflects the quality and location of the property. What did you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I understand that the apartment is newly built and in a prime location. However, as a student, I'm on a tight budget. I'm looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also affordable. I would like to propose a price that reflects my financial constraints. How about we start at \u20ac650 per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but \u20ac650 per month is below the market value for an apartment of this quality and location. While I appreciate your situation as a student, I must consider the investment I've made in this property. Would you be willing to reconsider your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Schmidt. As a student, I'm smart and I can appreciate the value of this property. However, my budget is limited, and I'm looking for a place that doesn't break the bank.

How about we meet in the middle? \u20ac800 per month would be a fair starting point for us to continue our discussion. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your proposal of \u20ac800 per month is more in line with what I expected. While it's still above my initial budget, I'm willing to compromise. I appreciate the quality of the apartment and the amenities it offers. I agree to the price of \u20ac800 Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm glad to hear that, Yi-Nuo Wang. \u20ac800 per month is indeed a fair price for this apartment.
