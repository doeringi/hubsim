[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Thank you for your interest in my apartment, Ms. Wang. I'm sure you'll find it to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. How much were you thinking of offering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I believe that the location and quality of your apartment are quite good. However, as a student, I am on a tight budget. Therefore, I would like to propose a rent of 800 Euro per month. Is this a price we can discuss?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 800 Euro per month is below my expectations for this apartment. It's a brand new, centrally located unit with all the amenities. I'm looking for a rent that reflects its value. How about we start at 1200 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your apartment does sound attractive, but as a student, I must be mindful of my expenses. A price of 1200 Euro per month is quite high for me. Could we find a middle ground? Perhaps 950 Euro per month? This would be more in line with what I can afford while still recognizing the quality of your apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "950 Euro per month is still below my asking price, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. How about 1050 Euro per month? This would be a fair compromise, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 1050 Euro per month is more reasonable, but I'm still trying to find the best deal for myself as a student. Would you be willing to consider 975 Euro per month? This would help me manage my finances better.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student and have financial constraints, but I must also consider the value of my property. 975 Euro per month is not acceptable to me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference again. How about 1025 Euro per month? This would be the lowest I can go, considering the location and the recent construction.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 1025 Euro per month is closer to my budget. I think this is a price that reflects the quality of your apartment while also being affordable for me as a student. I'm willing to accept this offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Wang. Your acceptance of 1025 Euro per month is reasonable, given the apartment's location and amenities. I agree to the price of 1025 Euro! Let's proceed with the rental agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Excellent, Mister Schmidt.
