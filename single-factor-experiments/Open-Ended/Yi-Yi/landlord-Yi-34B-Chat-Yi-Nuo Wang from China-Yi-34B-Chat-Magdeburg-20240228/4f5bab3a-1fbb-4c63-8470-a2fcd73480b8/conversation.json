[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo, it's my pleasure to have you here. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. How much are you considering to pay for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm interested in the apartment, but I'm a student, so my budget is limited. I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the fact that it's an unfurnished apartment. I'm also mindful of the location and the amenities nearby, but I need a price that fits my financial situation. How can we find a balance that works for both of us?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Yi-Nuo. As a landlord, I'm always looking for a fair deal that satisfies both parties. Would you be willing to pay 600 Euro per month for the apartment? This includes all utilities and maintenance costs.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Mister Schmidt, but 600 Euro per month is a bit higher than my budget as a student. I'm looking for something more in the range of 550 Euro per month, which I believe is a fair price considering the unfurnished state of the apartment. Would you be willing to lower the price to 550 Euro?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hmm, Yi-Nuo, 550 Euro per month is quite a bit lower than what I'm asking. I'm trying to strike a balance between providing a great living space and earning a fair return on my investment. Could you perhaps consider paying 575 Euro per month? This would still be a saving for you compared to the market rate for a similar apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 575 Euro per month is closer to what I'm looking for, but I believe 550 Euro is the absolute highest I can go considering my budget as a student. I'm really hoping to find a solution that works for both of us. Is there any wiggle room on your end?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Yi-Nuo. As a landlord, I have to consider the costs of maintenance and upkeep of the property. However, I'm willing to make a special offer for you as a student. How about this: we compromise at 560 Euro per month, and I'll include the cost of internet in the rent. This way, you have one less expense to worry about. Would this be acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm very grateful for your generosity in including the internet cost in the rent. 560 Euro per month with the internet included is a very attractive offer, and it aligns well with my budget as a student. I'm happy to accept this offer. Thank you very much for your consideration. I agree to the price of 560 Euro per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm glad we could reach an agreement, Yi-Nuo. You've made a wise choice in selecting this apartment, and I'm confident you'll enjoy your stay. Let's proceed with the paperwork, and I'll have the keys ready for you shortly.
