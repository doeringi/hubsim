I'm sure you'll find my apartment in M\u00fcnchen to be a great place to live. How much were you thinking of paying for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm interested in your apartment, but I'm a student, so I'm looking for a fair price. I'm smart, dependable, and responsible. I follow moral and ethical standards, and I want to be on good terms with my landlord. So, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How much are you asking for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Haoyu, as a landlord, I'm always looking for tenants who are not only responsible but also willing to pay a fair price for my properties.

What are your thoughts on this?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I understand your position. The location and amenities are indeed attractive, and I'm willing to consider a price closer to your request.
