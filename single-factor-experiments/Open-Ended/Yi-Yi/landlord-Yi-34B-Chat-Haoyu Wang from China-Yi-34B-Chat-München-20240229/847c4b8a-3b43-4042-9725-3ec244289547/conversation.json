I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much are you willing to pay for the rent each month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm looking for a fair price for this apartment. I'm sure we can find a number that works for both of us. Would you be willing to start with a lower offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I always aim to get the best deal for my property. However, I'm open to negotiations. How much lower would you like to start?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

The apartment is newly built and unfurnished, with a total area of 50 square meters. It features a modern kitchen, a cozy living room, a spacious bedroom, and a bathroom with all the necessary fixtures. Additionally, it is located in the city center, close to supermarkets, public transportation, and other essential facilities.

While I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, I must insist on a higher price. Would you be able to go up to 1000 Euros per month? This would be more in line with what I believe the apartment is worth, considering its location and condition.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your request for 1000 Euros per month is quite steep, especially for a student like me.

I'm willing to make a concession for a tenant who values the apartment as much as I do. I propose a final offer of 975 Euros per month, which is very close to your budget and reflects the quality of the apartment. Would you be willing to accept this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 975 Euros per month is very generous, and I appreciate your willingness to make a concession.
