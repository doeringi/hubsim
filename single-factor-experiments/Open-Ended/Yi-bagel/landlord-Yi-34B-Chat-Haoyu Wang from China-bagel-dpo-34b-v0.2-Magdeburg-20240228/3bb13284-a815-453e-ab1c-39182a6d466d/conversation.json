I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite satisfactory. How much were you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Mister Schmidt, I am a student and I am on a tight budget. Therefore, I would like to pay as little as possible. The apartment is nice, but I think the fair price for it is 300 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "300 Euros per month is a very low offer considering the prime location and the quality of the apartment. I'm sure you understand that I need to cover my costs and make a profit. Is there any room for negotiation on your part?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Of course, Mister Schmidt. I can understand your situation. Let's negotiate a bit. How about 350 Euros? It's a nice round number and I think it's a fair price for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "350 Euros is still quite low for an apartment of this caliber in the city center.

It's a fair compromise. I think we're getting closer to an agreement. Would you be willing to pay a little extra for utilities and amenities? It would help justify the rent a bit more.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds like a reasonable compromise. I agree to the price of 400 Euros per month for the rent. However, I hope we can discuss the utilities and amenities cost separately. I am willing to pay a fair price for those, of course.
