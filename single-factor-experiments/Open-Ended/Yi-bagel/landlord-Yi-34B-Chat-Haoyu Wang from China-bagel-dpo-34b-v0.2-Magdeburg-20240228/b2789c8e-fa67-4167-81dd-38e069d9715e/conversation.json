I'm sure you will find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient. How much were you thinking of paying for the rental?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student and I am looking for a place with the lowest price possible. I would like to pay 300 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 300 euros per month is much lower than my expectations.
