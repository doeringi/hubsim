I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient. Let's discuss the rental price. How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Given that the apartment is newly built and unfurnished, and it's also located in the city center with close proximity to important facilities, I believe 650 euros per month would be a fair price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 650 euros per month is not enough for such a prime location. I'm looking for a rent that reflects the value of the property and the amenities it offers. Would you be willing to reconsider your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point. Considering the city center location and the amenities, I am willing to increase my offer to 700 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "While 700 euros per month is more in line with the value of the property, I still believe it could be higher.

I hope we can find a middle ground.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your situation as a student, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, a deposit is standard practice to ensure the apartment is returned in good condition. Would you consider a smaller deposit, say 200 euros, or perhaps a higher monthly rent to compensate for the lack of a deposit?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your understanding. As a middle ground, I am willing to pay a deposit of 150 euros. Therefore, the rental price of 700 euros per month with a deposit of 150 euros is acceptable to me.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 700 euros per month with a deposit of 150 euros!
