[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Thank you for your interest in my apartment, Mister Wang. I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. How much were you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student and I am looking for an apartment with the lowest price possible. I would say 400 euros per month would be a reasonable price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Mister Wang, but 400 euros per month is much lower than the market value for this apartment. It's a brand new, centrally located unit with all amenities nearby. I think we can do better than that. How about 600 euros per month? It's a fair price considering the quality of the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's too high for me. I understand that the apartment is of high quality, but I am a student and I have a limited budget. I can offer 500 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "500 euros per month is still below my expectations, Mister Wang. This apartment is in high demand due to its prime location. I'm sure there are other tenants who would be willing to pay the market price. How about we meet in the middle at 550 euros per month? It's a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's still too high for me. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I cannot afford 550 euros per month. I will offer 450 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mister Wang, I'm sorry, but 450 euros per month is far below the market value for this apartment. I cannot accept such a low offer. If you're serious about renting this apartment, you need to reconsider your budget. How about 525 euros per month? It's a fair price that reflects the quality of the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your position, but 525 euros per month is still too high for me. I will offer 475 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mister Wang, I'm sorry, but 475 euros per month is not acceptable. This is a brand-new apartment in the city center with great accessibility. I'm sure there are many others who would be willing to pay the market price. How about 500 euros per month, which is a fair price for this property?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I appreciate your flexibility, and I understand your reasons for not accepting my previous offer. I am willing to meet you halfway. I will offer 487 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mister Wang, your offer of 487 euros per month is closer to my asking price, but it's still not enough for this prime location. I'm sure you can appreciate the value of the apartment in its current condition. How about 495 euros per month? It's a fair price that reflects the quality of the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Thank you for lowering the price. I accept your offer of 495 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm glad to hear that, Mister Wang. I agree to the price of 495 euros per month!
