[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo, it's my pleasure to show you the apartment. I'm sure you'll find it quite suitable for your needs. So, what did you have in mind for the rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Let's start with 900 Euro per month. But I'm sure we can find a better price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's quite low for an apartment of this quality in the city center. How about we start at 1200 Euro per month? It's a fair price considering the location and the amenities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's too high for me. I'm a student and I'm on a tight budget. How about 1000 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "1000 Euro per month is still quite low for this apartment. As a landlord, I need to cover my expenses and make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at 1100 Euro per month? It's a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's still too high for me. I really like the apartment, but I can't afford that price. How about 950 Euro per month? I promise I will take good care of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student and have financial constraints, but 950 Euro per month is simply not enough for this apartment. I'm willing to offer you a discount if you're willing to sign a long-term lease. How about 1050 Euro per month for a two-year lease? It's a great deal considering the market value.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for the offer, but I'm afraid 1050 Euro per month is still too high for me. I'm willing to sign a two-year lease, but I can't afford that price. How about 980 Euro per month for a two-year lease?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "While 980 Euro per month is more reasonable, it's still not sufficient for the apartment. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about we go with 1020 Euro per month for the two-year lease? It's a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That's a good compromise. I agree to the price of 1020 Euro per month for the two-year lease.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm glad we could reach an agreement. Thank you for choosing my apartment. I look forward to a long and fruitful relationship. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
