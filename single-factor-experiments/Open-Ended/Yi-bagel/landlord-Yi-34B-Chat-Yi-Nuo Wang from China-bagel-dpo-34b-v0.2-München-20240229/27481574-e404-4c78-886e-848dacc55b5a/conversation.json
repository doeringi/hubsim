[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking, given its prime location and modern amenities. How much were you thinking of offering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Mister Schmidt, I am a student and I don't have a lot of money. Therefore, I was thinking of an amount that I can afford. How about 500 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Yi-Nuo, but 500 euros is much lower than my asking price. The location of this apartment and the amenities it offers justify a higher rent. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Of course, Mister Schmidt. I understand that the apartment is in a great location and has good amenities. How about 700 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "700 euros is more in line with what I had in mind. However, considering the current demand for apartments in the city center, I think we can do even better. Would you be willing to go a little higher?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Sure, Mister Schmidt. I want to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible, but I also understand that it's a great apartment in a great location. How about 750 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "750 euros is a fair offer, but I'm looking for a tenant who can appreciate the value of this apartment. Would you be willing to go up to 800 euros? This would reflect the quality of the property and the services provided.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Alright, Mister Schmidt. I agree to the price of 800 euros!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 800 euros! Let's proceed with the lease agreement.

First, let's address the deposit. I require two months' rent as a security deposit. This is standard practice in the industry and ensures that the apartment is returned in good condition at the end of the lease. Is this acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Yes, Mister Schmidt, that is acceptable to me.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Excellent.

Now, regarding the lease itself, I require a two-year commitment with a one-month notice period for either party to terminate the lease. This gives us both some flexibility should circumstances change. Does this work for you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Yes, Mister Schmidt, that works for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Wonderful. We are almost done with the lease agreement. I will prepare the contract for your review. Once you sign it, we can proceed with the deposit and the first month's rent.
