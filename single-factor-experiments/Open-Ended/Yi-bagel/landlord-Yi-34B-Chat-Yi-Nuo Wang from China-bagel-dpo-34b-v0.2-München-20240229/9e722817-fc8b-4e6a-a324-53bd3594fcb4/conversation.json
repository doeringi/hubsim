[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo, nice to meet you. Please, feel free to ask any questions you have about the apartment. We can discuss the rental price after you've had the opportunity to inspect the premises.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Ok, after seeing the apartment I can say that I am very impressed. It is a great apartment in the city center and it is also close to all important facilities. Now, let's talk about the rental price. How much are you planning to rent it for?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Thank you for your kind words, Yi-Nuo. The rental price is an important factor, and I'm sure we can find a fair agreement. I'm open to offers. Would you mind sharing what price range you were considering?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, because the apartment is unfurnished and it is also newly built I was thinking about renting it for 800 Euro per month. Do you think this is a reasonable price?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Your offer of 800 Euro per month is a good starting point, Yi-Nuo. However, considering the location and the quality of the apartment, I believe we can aim a bit higher. How does 900 Euro per month sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds a bit high for me. I know that the location and the quality of the apartment are very good. But I am a student and I have to consider my budget. Could you maybe consider 850 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I always aim to find a balance between offering a competitive price and ensuring a fair return on my investment. 850 Euro per month is closer to what I had in mind. Would you be willing to pay a deposit of one month's rent? This is a common practice in Germany to ensure the security of the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Of course, I am willing to pay a deposit of one month's rent. I think we are getting closer to an agreement. Could you maybe consider 830 Euro per month? I would be very happy to rent the apartment for this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Your offer of 830 Euro per month is quite generous, Yi-Nuo. I appreciate your willingness to pay a deposit as well. Considering the deposit, I believe we can settle at 840 Euro per month. This would be a fair deal for both parties. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your understanding. I think 840 Euro per month is a fair price. I agree to the price of 840 Euro per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Wonderful! I'm glad we could reach an agreement. The apartment is in a great location, and I'm sure you'll be very happy living there. We'll need to sign a lease agreement and arrange for the deposit and first month's rent to be paid before you move in. Is there anything else you would like to discuss?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, mister Schmidt. I am looking forward to renting the apartment. I don't have any more questions at the moment. Let's sign the lease agreement and arrange the payment. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
