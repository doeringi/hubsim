I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. How much are you considering to pay for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, but I think the price is a bit high for my budget. I'm a student, so I'm looking for something more affordable. Would you be willing to lower the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I'm always looking for the best deal for my property. However, I'm willing to negotiate a bit if you can convince me that you're a reliable tenant. What is your budget?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "My budget is \u20ac600 per month.

Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about this: if you agree to pay \u20ac675 per month, I'll include all utilities in the price, and you won't have to worry about additional bills. This is a special offer just for you, considering your situation as a student.
