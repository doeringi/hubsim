It's still lower than my initial expectation, but given your student status, I'm willing to make a concession. Would you be willing to pay a deposit to secure the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Yes, I am willing to pay a deposit. What about 600 Euro per month and a deposit of 3 months rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Your offer of 600 Euro per month with a deposit of 3 months' rent is quite generous, and it reflects your willingness to commit to this apartment.
