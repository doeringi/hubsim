[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo, it's my pleasure to have you here. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. As for the rental price, I'm looking for the best deal for both of us. How much were you considering?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds good. Considering the apartment is unfurnished and has a size of 50 square meters, I would suggest a price of 600 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's quite a bit lower than what I was expecting. The location of this apartment is prime, and it's very close to all the amenities you might need. Could you perhaps reconsider your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that the location is good, but the apartment is unfurnished and has a relatively small size. Therefore, I propose an increase of 50 euros, so the price would be 650 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "650 Euros is still not quite what I'm looking for. This apartment is brand new and in a very sought-after area. I believe 750 Euros per month would be more in line with the value it offers. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, but as a student, I have a limited budget. I propose a price of 700 euros per month as a compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "700 Euros is still not acceptable to me. This apartment is in high demand, and I'm sure there are others who would be willing to pay more for such a prime location. Let's continue negotiating. How about 725 Euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. I propose a price of 710 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "710 Euros is closer to what I'm seeking, but I think we can do even better. How about 715 Euros? It's a nice round number and reflects the quality of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 715 Euros sounds like a fair price to me. I agree to the price of [715] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm glad we could come to an agreement. Thank you for your time, Yi-Nuo. I'm looking forward to having you as a tenant. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
