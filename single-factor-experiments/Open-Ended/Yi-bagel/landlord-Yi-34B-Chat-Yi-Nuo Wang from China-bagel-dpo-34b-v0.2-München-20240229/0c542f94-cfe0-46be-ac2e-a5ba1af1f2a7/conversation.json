[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much were you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "The apartment is nice, but the location is not that great. I am thinking of renting it for 500 Euros a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 Euros is much lower than the market value for an apartment of this quality in the city center. I'm looking for a rent that reflects the high standards and prime location. Would you be willing to reconsider your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understandable. The apartment is in the city center and it's close to all important facilities. I am willing to pay 600 Euros a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "600 Euros is more in line with what I had in mind. However, considering the recent increase in demand for city center apartments, I think we could push this a bit higher. Would you be open to paying, say, 650 Euros? This would ensure that the apartment is well-maintained and that you have a comfortable stay.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a reasonable proposal. Since the apartment is unfurnished, I will need to spend money on furniture. I am willing to pay 630 Euros a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "630 Euros is a step in the right direction, but I still believe the apartment's location and amenities justify a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at 675 Euros? This would be a fair deal for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "675 Euros seems a bit high. I don't want to spend too much on rent. I am willing to pay 650 Euros a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "If you're concerned about spending too much on rent, you might want to look for an apartment in a less central location. The city center comes at a premium, and 675 Euros is a fair price for what this apartment offers. However, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we compromise at 660 Euros per month? This would be the lowest I could accept.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 660 Euros a month!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 660 Euros a month!", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
