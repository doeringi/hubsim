[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much are you willing to pay for the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I am a student so I have a limited budget. I was wondering if you could lower the price to 300 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 300 Euros is far below my asking price. I'm looking to rent out my apartment for a fair market value. Would you be willing to pay more?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "What would be your lowest possible price? I am really interested in renting your apartment but I cannot afford to pay more than 350 Euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "350 Euros is still below my expectations. I'm looking for a tenant who can appreciate the quality and location of this apartment. Are you able to negotiate further?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Yes, of course. Considering the apartment is unfurnished and I have to buy furniture, I think 350 Euros is a reasonable price. I am willing to pay 375 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 375 Euros is still not enough for me to accept. This apartment is brand new and in a prime location. I'm looking for a rent that reflects its value. How about 425 Euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is too high for me. I can pay 400 Euros per month. I hope this is acceptable to you.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 400 Euros is still not enough for me to consider renting the apartment to you. This is a very competitive market, and I believe the apartment deserves a higher rent. How about 450 Euros? If you can't agree to this price, I'm afraid we'll have to look for other options.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood, Mister Schmidt. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I cannot afford to pay more than 400 Euros per month. I hope you understand my situation as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your position, but I must also look out for my own financial interests. Since we cannot agree on a price, I will have to terminate this negotiation. Good luck with your search for an apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your time, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate your honesty and understanding. I wish you the best of luck in finding a suitable tenant for your apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Thank you for your understanding, Yi-Nuo.
