[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Yi-Nuo Wang. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment in Magdeburg quite suitable for your needs. Let's discuss the rental price. How much were you considering?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student so I don't have a lot of money. I was thinking about 350 euros per month. That would be a great help for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "350 euros per month is quite a low price for an apartment of this quality in the city center. However, considering your situation as a student, I might be able to offer you a slightly discounted rate. How does 375 euros per month sound to you? It's a fair price for both parties, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, but I still have to study and work part-time to pay for my living expenses. So, I am afraid 375 euros is too expensive for me. I hope you can understand my situation.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student and money might be tight. However, the location and the quality of the apartment are quite valuable. Let's find a middle ground. How about 360 euros per month? This is the lowest I can go, considering the cost of living in the city center and the expenses I have as a landlord. What is your final offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for understanding my situation. 360 euros is still a bit too much for me. But I really like the apartment. So, I propose 355 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your effort in trying to reach a deal. However, 355 euros per month is below my cost price. I cannot afford to let the apartment for that amount. It's important for me to find a tenant who can pay a fair price. I'm sorry, but I cannot accept your offer. I hope you can find something more within your budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the rental price offered by you is still too high for me. I hope you understand.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand that the price is not within your budget, and I appreciate your time in considering my apartment. Good luck in finding a place that fits your needs and budget better.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you.
