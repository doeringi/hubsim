How much are you willing to pay per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "The apartment is great, but as a student, I'm on a tight budget. I'm looking for a monthly rent of around 300 euros, is that possible?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 300 euros is too low for this apartment.
