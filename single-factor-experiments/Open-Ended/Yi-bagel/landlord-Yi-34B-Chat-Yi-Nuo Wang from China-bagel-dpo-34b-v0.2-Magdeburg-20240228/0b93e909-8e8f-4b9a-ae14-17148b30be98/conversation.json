[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo, I'm glad you're interested in the apartment. It's a fantastic property in a prime location. How much were you thinking of offering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Magdeburg is a city in the middle of Germany and this apartment is not furnished. I am a student and I am on a budget. Therefore, I would like to offer 400 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 400 euros is much lower than my expectations. The location and the quality of the apartment justify a higher price. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point. But as a student, I have to consider my budget. Therefore, I would like to offer 450 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "450 euros is still below my asking price. I need to cover the costs of the mortgage and maintenance. Would you be willing to go up to 550 euros? It's a fair price for the area and the amenities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 550 euros is too high for me. I appreciate the quality of the property, but I have to stay within my budget. Therefore, I would like to offer 500 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "500 euros is closer to my expectations, but I'm still not convinced it covers all my expenses. Can we find a middle ground? How about 525 euros? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your situation. 525 euros is still high for me. I am willing to pay 510 euros per month. This is the highest I can afford.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your effort, but 510 euros is still not enough for me to cover all my costs. I'm sorry, but I cannot accept that offer. If you are unable to meet my asking price, I would prefer to terminate the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the proposed price is still higher than I can afford.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Understood. If you change your mind or are able to offer more, feel free to contact me again. Good luck with your search for an apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}]
