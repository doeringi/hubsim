[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be in an excellent location with all the amenities you need. How much were you thinking of offering for the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "The apartment is in the city center, and it's close to all important facilities. I think 500 euros per month would be reasonable.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's much lower than my expectations. The location and the recent construction of the apartment justify a higher price. How about we start at 700 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a big difference. I'm a student, and I'm trying to save money. I could do 650 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I have to cover my costs and make a profit. 650 euros is still below my asking price.

I think this is a fair price for a student apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I have to consider the current market rates and the quality of the apartment. 625 euros is too low for an unfurnished apartment in the city center.

If you can't agree to that price, I'll have to look for another tenant.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I think 675 euros per month is too high for a student apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, but the market rates and the quality of the apartment are factors that justify the price.
