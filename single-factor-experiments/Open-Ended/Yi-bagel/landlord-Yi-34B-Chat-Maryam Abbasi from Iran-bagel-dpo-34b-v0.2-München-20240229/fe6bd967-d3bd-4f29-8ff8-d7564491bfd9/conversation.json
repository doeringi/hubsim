[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much were you thinking of paying for rent each month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Mister Schmidt, I am a student and I am looking for the best price possible. I was thinking of starting at 300 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "300 euros per month is a very generous offer, Maryam. However, as you can see, my apartment is brand new and in a prime location. It would be fair to say that a place like this could easily fetch a higher price. What do you think about 500 euros per month? It's a fair price for such a luxurious dwelling.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, Mister Schmidt. However, I am a student and I have a limited budget. I am willing to pay 400 euros per month. I believe this is a fair price for a student like me.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "400 euros per month is an interesting offer, Maryam. While it may not be the highest price I could get, it's a respectable amount for a student. I'm willing to consider it. Would you be willing to pay a small deposit to secure the apartment? Perhaps 500 euros? This would cover any potential damages and ensure the apartment's condition when you move out.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your offer. However, as I said, I am a student and my budget is quite limited. I am willing to pay a deposit, but I was thinking of 200 euros. I believe this is a fair price for a student like me.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "200 euros as a deposit is quite low, Maryam. I'm afraid I can't accept that. However, I understand that you're a student and have financial constraints. Let's find a middle ground. How about a deposit of 300 euros? This would be non-refundable and would cover any damages beyond normal wear and tear. In addition, I would require you to pay your rent for the first three months in advance, which would be 1,200 euros. This would give you a year's lease with the option to renew. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I understand your concerns. I am willing to pay the deposit of 300 euros. However, paying rent for the first three months in advance is quite a burden for me as a student. I am willing to pay 400 euros per month, but I cannot pay it in advance. I believe this is a fair offer for a student like me.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Maryam, but I cannot accept your offer. The apartment is in high demand, and I'm looking for a tenant who can meet my terms. If you're unable to pay the deposit and the first three months' rent in advance, I will have to consider other potential tenants who can meet my conditions. It's nothing personal, but business is business.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand, Mister Schmidt. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I am unable to meet your financial conditions at the moment. I hope you find a suitable tenant soon.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Thank you for your time, Maryam. I appreciate your effort. I'm sure we'll find a tenant who can meet our terms. Good luck with your search for a place. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
