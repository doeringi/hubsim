[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient, especially with its central location. How much were you thinking of offering for the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student so I am on a budget. I was thinking about 500 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's much lower than my asking price. The location and the quality of the apartment justify a higher rent. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Sure, I can increase my offer a little bit. How about 550 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "While 550 euros is closer to my expectations, I still believe the apartment is worth more considering its prime location and modern amenities. Would you be willing to go a bit higher?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Yes, I can do that. How about 600 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Your offer of 600 euros is more in line with what I had in mind. However, if you're willing to pay a bit more, I could offer you a discount on the security deposit or include some utilities in the price. What do you think? Would you be willing to negotiate further?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds fair. How about we agree on 625 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 625 euros is still not my asking price. If you're truly interested in the apartment, I would expect you to offer closer to 700 euros per month. This would reflect the true value of the apartment and its location. Are you willing to consider this?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point. However, 700 euros is quite a bit for me. Given the fact that the apartment is unfurnished, I think 650 euros would be more reasonable.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your effort to meet in the middle, but 650 euros is still not enough for such a prime location. The apartment is brand new and in a highly sought-after area, which justifies a higher rent. If you're serious about renting the apartment, I would expect you to come closer to my asking price. How about 675 euros per month? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the quality and the location of the apartment. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 675 euros [[/-]", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I can't accept that price. It's simply not enough for the apartment I'm offering. If you're not willing to pay a fair price, I'd rather keep the apartment vacant until I find a tenant who values it appropriately.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your point. Let's agree on 675 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 675 euros!", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Fantastic! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. If you're ready to proceed, please feel free to sign the lease agreement and prepare the necessary documents for the rental application. I'm looking forward to having you as a tenant.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
