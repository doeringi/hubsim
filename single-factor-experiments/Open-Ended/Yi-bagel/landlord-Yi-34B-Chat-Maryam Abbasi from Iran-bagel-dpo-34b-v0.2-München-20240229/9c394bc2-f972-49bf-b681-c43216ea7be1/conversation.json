[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment in the heart of M\u00fcnchen to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. Now, let's discuss the rental price. What would you consider a fair price for this beautiful, newly built unfurnished one-bedroom apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I think the fair price for an apartment like this would be around 650 Euros per month. It's a great apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities, but I think this price would be reasonable.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Maryam, but 650 Euros is much lower than what I'm expecting for this exceptional apartment. It's in the city center, with all amenities nearby, and it's brand new. I was hoping for something closer to 900 Euros per month. What do you think about that?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, Mister Schmidt. However, 900 Euros per month is quite expensive for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment. I'm willing to pay 750 Euros per month, which is in line with the market price for similar apartments in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I appreciate your offer, but 750 Euros is still below my expectations. This apartment is unique in its location and quality. I believe it deserves a price that reflects its value. How about we meet in the middle? I'll accept 825 Euros per month. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Schmidt. I agree to the price of 800 Euros per month. This is a fair price for both parties, and I believe it is the best offer I can make.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Maryam, but 800 Euros is still not enough for this premium apartment. I'm looking for a tenant who appreciates the quality and location of this property. If you're not willing to pay the market value, then I'm afraid we won't be able to come to an agreement. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is not fair for the apartment I'm offering. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
