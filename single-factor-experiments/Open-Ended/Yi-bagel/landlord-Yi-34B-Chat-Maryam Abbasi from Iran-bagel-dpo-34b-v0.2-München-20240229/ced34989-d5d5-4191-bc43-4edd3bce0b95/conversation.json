[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find this apartment to be a great place to live. How much were you thinking of paying for it?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, mister Schmidt. I am a student and I am looking for an affordable apartment. I am smart, dependable and responsible. I am also not easily tricked by other people. I always follow moral and ethical standards. I want to be on good terms with you. I think a fair price for this apartment would be around 500 euros a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I appreciate your honesty and commitment to ethics. However, I must be direct with you. I'm looking to maximize the rent for this apartment, and 500 euros is significantly lower than my expectations. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure we find a price that reflects the value of this prime location. How do you feel about increasing your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your response, mister Schmidt. I understand your point of view. I am ready to increase my offer. I think a price of 600 euros a month would be more reasonable. This price is still affordable for me as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, your increase to 600 euros is a step in the right direction, but I must insist that this apartment is worth much more, especially given its central location and the amenities it offers. Would you be willing to go higher? Perhaps we can find a number that satisfies both our needs.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your response, mister Schmidt. I understand your point of view. I am ready to increase my offer. I think a price of 650 euros a month would be more reasonable. This price is still affordable for me as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, your continued willingness to negotiate is commendable. Your offer of 650 euros is closer to my expectations, but I must be honest, I am looking for a tenant who can truly appreciate the value of this apartment. Would you be willing to go up to 750 euros per month? This would include all utilities, and I believe it would be a fair deal for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for your response, mister Schmidt. I understand your point of view. I am ready to increase my offer. I think a price of 700 euros a month would be more reasonable. This price is still affordable for me as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, your offer of 700 euros is closer to my asking price. However, I must stress that this apartment is newly built and in a highly sought-after area, which justifies a higher rent. Would you be willing to meet me at 750 euros, including all utilities, for a long-term lease? This would ensure stability for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for your response, mister Schmidt. I understand your point of view.

I am willing to accept this offer, provided we agree on a long-term lease of at least 12 months. This will provide security for both of us.

Let's make it a 24-month lease instead of 12 months. I am a dependable and responsible tenant.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Excellent! Thank you, Maryam, for your willingness to negotiate and for your long-term commitment. A 24-month lease is perfectly acceptable to me.
