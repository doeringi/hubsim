I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs.

While I appreciate your request, I must be honest with you. The market value for apartments in this area, especially for a newly built one, is much higher than what you're offering. However, I'm willing to negotiate a bit if you're willing to pay a fair price. How does 500 euros a month sound to you? It's a reasonable rate for the location and amenities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is still too much for me. I could do 400 euros a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "While 400 euros is more in line with what I had in mind, I think we can work with that. However, I would like to offer you a 1-year contract with a 3% discount if you're willing to pay 450 euros a month. This would bring the total cost down to 435 euros a month, which I believe is a fair price for both parties. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds more reasonable. I agree to the price of 435 euros a month!", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm glad to hear that we've reached an agreement. The apartment will be yours for 435 euros a month. Please let me know when you're ready to sign the lease and make the initial deposit. We'll need to go over the terms of the contract, but I'm sure everything will be in order. Thank you for choosing my apartment, and I look forward to a long and fruitful relationship.
