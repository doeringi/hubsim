[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient, given its central location and modern amenities. How much were you thinking of offering for the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Mister Schmidt, I am a student and I am looking for a place that is affordable for me. I would like to offer 500 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Maryam, but 500 euros per month is much lower than the market value for this apartment. It's a brand new, unfurnished unit in the city center, which usually commands a higher price. Can you consider offering more?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, Mister Schmidt. However, as a student, I have a limited budget. I am willing to pay 600 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "600 euros per month is still below what I would expect for this apartment. It's a great location, with easy access to public transportation and amenities. How about 750 euros per month? That's a fair price considering the value of the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 750 euros per month is a bit high for me, Mister Schmidt. I am willing to pay 700 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "700 euros per month is closer to what I'm looking for, but it's still not quite there. This apartment is brand new and in a highly desirable area. To reflect the quality and location, I'd like to propose 800 euros per month. This is a fair price for both parties, in my opinion. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of 750 euros per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I can't accept that. The apartment is worth more than that. I'm looking for a price that reflects the value of the property, which is why I suggested 800 euros per month. If you're not willing to pay that, I'm not interested in continuing the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price difference is too large and we cannot find a middle ground.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Understood. If you change your mind or are willing to consider a higher price, please let me know. Until then, I'll consider other potential tenants.
