However, I'm sure you're aware that the current market rates for similar apartments in the city center are higher.

However, I'm concerned about the potential for rent increases in the future. If the market prices rise, I wouldn't want to be stuck with the same rent for three years. How about we agree on a slightly higher rent, say 420 euros per month, and review the rent every six months? That way, we can adjust to market changes more flexibly.
