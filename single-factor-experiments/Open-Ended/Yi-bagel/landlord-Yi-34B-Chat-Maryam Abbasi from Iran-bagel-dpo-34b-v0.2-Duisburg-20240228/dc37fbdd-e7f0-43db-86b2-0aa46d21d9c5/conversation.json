[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient, given its location in the city center. How much were you thinking of offering for the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Duisburg is not exactly a high-cost city, and the apartment is also unfurnished. So, I was thinking of 500 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I see. 500 euros per month is a reasonable offer, considering the size and location of the apartment. However, I must admit that I was hoping for something a bit higher, given the current demand for rental properties in the area. Would you be willing to negotiate a higher price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Sure, I can consider a higher price. But you should consider that the apartment is unfurnished and I am a student. So, a higher price would put a significant burden on my budget. How about 550 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I understand your concern as a student. 550 euros per month is a fair offer, considering the market value of similar apartments in the city center. However, I must insist that my asking price is slightly higher than that. Would you be willing to come up to 600 euros per month? This would be my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your final offer, Mr. Schmidt. However, 600 euros per month is quite high for me as a student. I am willing to pay 575 euros per month, and that is my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 575 euros per month is not acceptable to me. I need to find a tenant who is willing to pay the market value for this prime location. If you're unable to meet my asking price of 600 euros per month, I'm afraid we'll have to terminate the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mr. Schmidt. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we have reached an impasse in terms of the rental price. I offered my final price, and you offered yours. It's unfortunate, but I cannot afford your asking price. Thank you for your time and consideration.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry to hear that, Maryam. If you change your mind or are able to reconsider your price, feel free to contact me. In the meantime, I'll continue to look for a tenant who is willing to pay the market value for this apartment.
