I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite appealing, given its prime location and modern amenities.

I am a student and I am looking for an apartment that fits my budget. I am willing to spend up to 500 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, your budget is quite low for the area, especially for a newly built apartment in the city center. However, I'm willing to negotiate. How does 550 euros sound to you? This is already a discounted rate considering the market value.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, mister Schmidt. Your offer is very generous.

I hope we can still find a solution.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your budget constraints, Maryam, but 500 euros is significantly below the market value for this apartment. Let's consider the amenities and location \u2013 these are highly sought after and usually command a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at 525 euros per month? This is still a great deal for you considering what the apartment offers.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, mister Schmidt.

At 500 euros per month, I would be losing money on the apartment. I'm willing to negotiate, but I cannot go below 525 euros. This is already a substantial discount for you. Can we agree on this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 500 euros [yourprice] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Maryam, but I cannot accept 500 euros per month.
