[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Ms. Abbasi, it's my pleasure to have you here. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be quite comfortable and convenient, given its central location. So, let's discuss the price. How much were you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I'm a student and I'm on a budget, so I was thinking about 300 euros per month. That would be a great help for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "300 euros per month is quite a low offer, especially for an apartment in the city center. I have to consider the expenses of maintaining such a property. However, I understand that as a student, you're on a budget. How about we meet in the middle? 450 euros per month would be more fair, considering the location and the recent construction. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite a gap between our offers. I appreciate your position, but given my financial situation, I'm not able to afford 450 euros per month. How about we find a compromise at 350 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "350 euros is still quite low for the apartment, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since you're a student, I'll consider your situation. How about we agree on 400 euros per month? This is the lowest I can go, considering the investment I've made in this property. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my situation. While 400 euros is still a bit high for me, I understand that you have made a considerable investment in this property.

Can we make it 390 euros per month, and I'll throw in a small discount on the deposit? This way, you get a good deal, and I can still manage the costs. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your generosity. I appreciate the small discount on the deposit. Let's agree on 390 euros per month, and I'll make sure to have a good relationship with you as my landlord.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Fantastic! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. The apartment will be a great place for you to live, and I'm sure you'll enjoy the central location.
