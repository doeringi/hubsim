[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs.

I'm looking for a price that reflects the quality and convenience of the apartment. How about we start at 500 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is too high for me.

However, the location of this apartment is very central, which adds value. If you're looking for a lower price, you might have to consider a less convenient location. How about 450 euros per month?

However, 400 euros is still below my expectations. This apartment is brand new and in a highly sought-after area. The demand for such apartments is high, and I can afford to be selective with my rent. How about we meet in the middle at 475 euros per month? This is a fair price that reflects the quality of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That is still too high. I will pay 450 euros per month.

However, let me remind you that finding an apartment in the city center with such amenities is not easy, especially at the price you're offering. The demand for this type of rental is high, and I have the advantage of time on my side. I can wait for a tenant who values the location and quality of this apartment. How about one last offer? 475 euros per month, and I'll include a free month of parking, which is a substantial saving for you. This is my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of 450 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot accept that price.
