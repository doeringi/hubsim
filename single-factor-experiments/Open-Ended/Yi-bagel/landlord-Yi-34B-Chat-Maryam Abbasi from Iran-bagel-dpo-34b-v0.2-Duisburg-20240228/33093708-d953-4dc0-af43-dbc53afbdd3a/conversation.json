[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a great fit for your needs.

I was thinking about 300 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student and looking to save money. However, the price you're offering is quite low for the area and the quality of the apartment. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point. How about 350 euros per month? It's a fair price for a student like me.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "350 euros is more in line with what I was expecting. However, I think we can do even better. How about 400 euros per month? This would include all utilities as well. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a good offer, but I still think it's a bit high for my budget.

I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we have reached an impasse and I cannot pay more than 385 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry to hear that. It seems we're not able to reach an agreement at this time. I wish you the best of luck in your search for a suitable apartment. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
