[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Farhad, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment to be a great fit for your needs. How much are you willing to pay for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I am a student and I am looking for the most cost-effective housing option. Considering that the apartment is unfurnished, I think a fair price would be around 500 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 euros per month is far below the market value for an apartment of this size and location. The minimum I would accept is 800 euros per month. Is this within your budget?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, considering the apartment's location and size, I believe 800 euros per month is quite reasonable. However, as a student, I am on a tight budget. Would you be willing to consider 650 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "No, I'm sorry, but 650 euros per month is still too low for this apartment. The location alone warrants a higher price. I can offer you a discount of 50 euros per month if you sign a two-year lease, making the rent 850 euros per month. This is my final offer. Is this acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I appreciate your offer. However, as a student, I need to keep my expenses as low as possible. Would you be willing to consider 700 euros per month with a two-year lease?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "No, I'm sorry, but I cannot go below 850 euros per month with a two-year lease. This is already a significant discount from the market value. If you are unable to afford this price, I understand, but I cannot negotiate further.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I understand your position. However, I must prioritize affordability as a student. I am afraid 850 euros per month is out of my budget. Therefore, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the rental price is beyond my means as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry to hear that, Farhad. If you are unable to afford the 850 euros per month with a two-year lease, then we will have to terminate the negotiation. Please let me know if you have any other questions or if there is anything else I can assist you with.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Schmidt. Let's terminate the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
