[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello, Farhad. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find this apartment to be a great investment for your stay in Munich. How much are you willing to pay for such a prime location in the city center?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer. However, I would like to propose a rental price that is more in line with the average price of apartments in the city center. Can we start with an offer of 800 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 800 Euros per month is simply not enough for an apartment of this quality and location. I'm looking for a price that reflects the true value of this property. How about we start at 1200 Euros per month? It's a fair price considering the amenities and the proximity to all the city's attractions. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, but 1200 Euros per month is quite expensive for me. I was hoping for something more affordable, especially since the apartment is unfurnished. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? How about 1000 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hmm, 1000 Euros per month is still not what I'm looking for. This apartment is brand new and in a highly sought-after area. The demand for such properties is high, and I believe a price closer to 1150 Euros per month would be more appropriate. What is your final offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point of view. However, considering that the apartment is unfurnished and the market conditions, I believe that 1000 Euros per month is a fair price. I hope we can find a middle ground. How about 1050 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot accept that offer. The apartment's location and amenities justify a higher price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that rate. Let's continue discussing. How about 1100 Euros per month? It's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I appreciate your flexibility. After careful consideration, I am willing to meet you halfway. Therefore, I am ready to rent the apartment for 1075 Euros per month. I hope we can finally agree on this price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 1075 Euros per month is still not sufficient for this apartment. The demand for such properties in the city center is high, and I must ensure that the rent reflects the true value of the property. Let's continue negotiating. How about 1090 Euros per month?
