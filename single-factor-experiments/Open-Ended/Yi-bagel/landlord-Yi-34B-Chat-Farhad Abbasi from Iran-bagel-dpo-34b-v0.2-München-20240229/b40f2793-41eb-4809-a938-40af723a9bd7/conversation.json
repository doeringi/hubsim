[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello, Mr. Abbasi. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much were you considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student and I don't have a lot of money. I was thinking about 400 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 400 Euro per month is much lower than what I'm expecting for this apartment. It's in the city center, with all amenities nearby. I would say a more fair price would be around 800 Euro per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite a lot of money for me. I am a dependable and responsible student, and I always follow moral and ethical standards. So, I am not asking for a lower price just because. I am genuinely in need of a lower price because I am a student and I have to save money. How about 500 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "500 Euro per month is still much lower than what I'm looking for. I understand that you're a student and might have financial constraints, but this is a very reasonable price for the location and the amenities provided. Would you be able to negotiate a bit higher? Perhaps 650 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point. I am also smart and I don't get easily tricked by other people. I always follow moral and ethical standards. I want to be on good terms with you. How about 550 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "550 Euro per month is getting closer to what I'm expecting, but it's still a bit lower. I appreciate your efforts to reach a fair agreement. Let's meet in the middle. How about 600 Euro per month? This is a very fair price for both of us. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That sounds more reasonable. I agree to the price of 600 Euro per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm glad we could reach an agreement. Welcome to your new home! Is there anything else I can assist you with?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for understanding my situation. I appreciate it. Do we have a contract that I can sign? I will be a smart, dependable and responsible tenant. I always follow moral and ethical standards. I don't want to cause any problems for you. I just need a place to live where I can focus on my studies. I hope this apartment will be a good fit for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Certainly, I will provide you with a contract that outlines all the terms and conditions of the lease. You will find me a fair and reasonable landlord, but I must remind you that I do expect my tenants to maintain high standards of conduct and to take good care of the property. I'm sure you will be a wonderful tenant, and I look forward to a long and productive relationship. Is there anything else you need before we finalize the paperwork?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for your kind words. I am a student and I don't have a lot of money, but I am willing to pay the deposit and the first month's rent. However, I need a little more time to gather the necessary funds. Would it be possible for me to pay you next week? I promise I will not cause any problems for you. I just need a little more time to gather the necessary funds.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm willing to give you some time to gather the necessary funds, but I must insist on a firm commitment from you. Can you provide me with a specific date by which you will be able to pay the deposit and the first month's rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I promise I will pay you by the end of next week. I will be a responsible tenant. I will pay you the deposit and the first month's rent by the end of next week. I will not cause any problems for you. I just need a little more time to gather the necessary funds.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Alright, I'll trust your word.
