[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Farhad, it's my pleasure to have you here. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. So, what price were you considering for the rental?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student and I am looking for an apartment with the lowest price possible. Since the apartment is unfurnished, I think a price of 400 Euro per month would be more reasonable.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 400 Euros per month is far below my asking price. This is a prime location in the city center, and I'm looking for a rent that reflects the value of the property. How about we start at 800 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite a high price for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment. I understand that the location is good, but the furniture and the size do not justify the price. I am smart and I am not easily tricked by other people. I always follow moral and ethical standards. I want to be on good terms with you. So, I would like to propose 500 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your honesty and commitment to ethical standards, but 500 Euros per month is still not acceptable. The market value for such a property, especially in the city center, is much higher. Let's meet in the middle. How about 650 Euros per month? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the quality and location of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "While 650 Euros per month is more reasonable, I still believe that it is a high price for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I don't want to pay more than 600 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your position, but 600 Euros per month is simply not enough for an apartment of this caliber, especially in the city center. The amenities and the location alone warrant a higher rent. If you're unwilling to pay 650 Euros per month, I'm afraid we might have to terminate the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Alright, if you don't want to continue the negotiation, I understand. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I don't want to pay more than 600 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry to hear that, but I cannot accept your offer of 600 Euros per month. Therefore, I must terminate the negotiation. I hope you find an apartment that meets your needs and budget. Thank you for your time.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Schmidt. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}]
