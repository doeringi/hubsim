[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Abbasi, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find the apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much are you willing to pay for the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I am a student so I would like to pay as low as possible. But I am also smart and responsible so I can assure you I will take good care of your apartment. How about if I pay 500 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 euros per month is far below my expectations. This is a prime location with a modern, unfurnished apartment. I believe a more reasonable offer would be around 950 euros per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I see. The apartment is indeed in a great location. But as I said, I am a student so I am on a tight budget. How about if I pay 650 euros per month and I will cover all the utilities?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "650 euros per month plus utilities is still not acceptable. I'm looking for a tenant who can appreciate the value of this property. The market value for this apartment is around 1200 euros per month. Could you reconsider your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your point. But 1200 euros is really expensive for me. I have to consider my budget. How about if I pay 800 euros per month and we can sign a two-year contract?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "An offer of 800 euros per month with a two-year contract is more in line with what I would consider. However, I would like to have the option to review the rent after one year, considering the market rates at that time. Would you be open to this condition?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That sounds reasonable to me. I agree to the price of 800 euros per month with a two-year contract and the option to review the rent after one year.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 800 euros per month with a two-year contract and the option to review the rent after one year.
