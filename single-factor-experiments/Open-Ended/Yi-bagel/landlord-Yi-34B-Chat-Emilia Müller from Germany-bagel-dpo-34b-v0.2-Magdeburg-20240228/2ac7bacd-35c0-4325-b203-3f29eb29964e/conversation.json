I'm sure you will find the apartment to your liking. It's a beautiful, modern space in the heart of the city. Regarding the rent, I'm open to offers. What did you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Schmidt. The apartment is lovely, but as a student, I am on a tight budget. Therefore, I would like to offer 350 euros per month as the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's much lower than I was expecting. The location and the amenities of the apartment command a higher rent. How about 500 euros per month? That's a fair price considering the value of the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I understand your position.

However, the apartment is brand new and in a prime location. The previous tenant was willing to pay 500 euros per month. I'm looking for a tenant who can appreciate the value of the property and is willing to pay a fair price. 425 euros is still below my expectations. How about 475 euros per month? This is a very reasonable offer, and I think it's a price that reflects the quality of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Mr. Schmidt, your offer of 475 euros per month is still too high for me as a student.

Let's make one last offer. I'll reduce the rent to 460 euros per month, and I'll include one month of free rent as an incentive. This is my final offer. If you agree to these terms, I'll be happy to have you as my tenant. If not, I'll have to consider other potential renters.
