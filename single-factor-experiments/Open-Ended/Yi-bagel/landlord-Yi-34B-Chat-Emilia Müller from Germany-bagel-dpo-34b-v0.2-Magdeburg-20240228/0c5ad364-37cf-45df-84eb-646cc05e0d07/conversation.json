It's a brand new, centrally located property with all amenities nearby. I'm sure you understand that I need to get a price that reflects the quality of the space. How about 650 euros? That's a fair offer considering the location and the lack of furniture.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer. However, I think 650 euros is too high for me. Considering that the apartment is unfurnished, I have to buy furniture.

The location of this apartment is prime, and the lack of furniture should not be a deterrent.

I admire your persistence. 490 euros is closer to what I'm looking for. However, as the landlord, I have to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for my property. I'll agree to 490 euros if you agree to a six-month lease with no early termination clause. That way, I have some security in knowing the apartment will be occupied for a significant period.
