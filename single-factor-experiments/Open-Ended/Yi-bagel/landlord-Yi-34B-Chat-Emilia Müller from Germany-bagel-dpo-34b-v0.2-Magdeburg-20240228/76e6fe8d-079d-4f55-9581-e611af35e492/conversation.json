I'm sure you'll find this apartment to be a great investment. How much were you thinking of offering for the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student and I am on a tight budget. I was thinking of 350 euros per month. It would be a great help if you could consider this offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 350 euros is much lower than my expectations. The location and the quality of the apartment certainly warrant a higher price. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, but as I mentioned, I am a student and I am on a tight budget.
