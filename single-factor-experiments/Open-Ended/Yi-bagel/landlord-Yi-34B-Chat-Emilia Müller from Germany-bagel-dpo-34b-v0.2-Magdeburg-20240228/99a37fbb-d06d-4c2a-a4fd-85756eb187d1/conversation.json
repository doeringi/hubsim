I was thinking of \u20ac350 per month. It would be a great help for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's quite below my expectations. The location and the amenities of the apartment justify a higher price. Would you be willing to offer more?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point. However, I am struggling financially.

Would you be able to go higher?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree that \u20ac375 might be too low. However, \u20ac450 is a bit too high for me. How about \u20ac425 per month? It is a reasonable price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "\u20ac425 is closer to what I'm looking for, but it's still not quite there. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. Would you be able to meet in the middle at \u20ac437.50? That way, we're both compromising.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of \u20ac437.50 per month!
