I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a comfortable and convenient place to live.

It's a newly built unit with modern amenities. I'm sure you understand that I need to cover my costs and make a profit.

I'm looking for a tenant who can appreciate the value of this apartment. Let's say 400 euros per month, all inclusive. This is my final offer. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my situation. However, 400 euros per month is still a bit high for me.

If you're unable to meet my asking price, I'm afraid we cannot proceed. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is not acceptable to me.
