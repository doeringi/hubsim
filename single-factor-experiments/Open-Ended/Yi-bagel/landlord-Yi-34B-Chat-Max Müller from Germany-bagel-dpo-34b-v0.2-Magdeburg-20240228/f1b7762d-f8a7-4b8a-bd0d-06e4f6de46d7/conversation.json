I was thinking about 350 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 350 euros per month is far below my expectations for this apartment. It's a brand new construction in the city center, with all the amenities you could ask for. I think a more reasonable offer would be around 650 euros per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite a high price. Given that the apartment is unfurnished, I think 500 euros would be more reasonable.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 euros is still not acceptable. The location, the quality of construction, and the amenities all contribute to the value of this apartment. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price. How about 600 euros?
