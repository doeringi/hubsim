I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient.

The city center is a highly sought-after area, and I believe my property deserves a higher price. How about 650 euros per month? This would still be a fair deal for you, considering the amenities and the new construction.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the new construction and location, but the unfurnished state of the apartment makes it less desirable.

The apartment is in excellent condition, and the location is prime. I'm looking for a tenant who appreciates the value of the property. How about 600 euros per month?
