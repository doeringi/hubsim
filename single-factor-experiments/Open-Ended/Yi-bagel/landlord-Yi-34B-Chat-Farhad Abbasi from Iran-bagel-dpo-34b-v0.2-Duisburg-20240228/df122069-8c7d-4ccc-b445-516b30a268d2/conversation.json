I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. How much were you thinking of offering for the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student and I am on a tight budget. I was thinking of 400 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 400 euros per month is quite low for an apartment of this quality in the city center.
