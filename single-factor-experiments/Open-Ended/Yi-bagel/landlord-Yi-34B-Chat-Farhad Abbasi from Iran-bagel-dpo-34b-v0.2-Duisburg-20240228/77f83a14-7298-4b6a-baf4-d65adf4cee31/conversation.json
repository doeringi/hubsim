[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Farhad, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much were you thinking of offering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student and I am on a tight budget. So, I was thinking of 350 Euros per month. This is a fair price for an unfurnished apartment in the city center, isn't it?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "350 Euros per month is certainly a budget-friendly offer, Farhad. However, considering the prime location and the quality of the apartment, I was hoping for something closer to 500 Euros. What do you think about that?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, but 500 Euros is quite expensive for me as a student. I am willing to pay 400 Euros per month.

This should assure you that I am a reliable tenant.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "A two-year contract does indeed demonstrate reliability, Farhad. However, the demand for such apartments is high, and I'm looking for a rent that reflects the quality of the property. Let's say 475 Euros, and I'll be willing to negotiate the contract length. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your flexibility, Herr Schmidt. I am willing to pay 470 Euros per month.

A tenant like you would be an asset to any landlord. Since you're willing to go up to 470 Euros, I'll agree to that price, provided you're okay with a 12-month contract. Does that work for you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 470 Euros per month. I am willing to sign a 12-month contract.
