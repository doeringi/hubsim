I'm sure you'll find my apartment to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. Regarding the rental price, I'm looking for the best offer that reflects the quality of the apartment. Would you like to make a proposal?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer. But I'm still in negotiation process. I'm hoping for a lower price. The apartment is nice, but the unfurnished condition and the lack of appliances will be costly for me to furnish. I also need to pay for utilities. So, I'm proposing 450 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concerns, Mister Abbasi. However, the location and the quality of the apartment are quite exceptional. The city center is a prime area, and the proximity to essential facilities is a major selling point. The apartment itself is brand new, with modern construction and design. While it's true that it's unfurnished, this gives tenants the freedom to personalize their space according to their tastes. As for the appliances, the building does have common laundry facilities, and the kitchen is equipped with the necessary plumbing and electrical infrastructure to install your own appliances. I'm sorry, but 450 euros per month is below my expectations for such a property.

How about 500 euros per month, and I'll include a basic package of utilities for the first six months? This would help you settle in without the immediate burden of setting up utilities. Additionally, I could provide you with a list of reputable furniture rental companies that offer student discounts. This way, you can furnish your apartment without a large upfront cost. Would 500 euros with the utility package be more acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your compromise. I appreciate it. But as a student, I need to save money as much as possible. So, I'm proposing 490 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your need to save money, Mister Abbasi. However, I must maintain a fair price for the apartment. The location and the quality of the building justify a higher rent. Let's continue to negotiate. How about this: I'll agree to 495 euros per month, and I'll include the basic utility package for the first three months. This should help you get started without overburdening your budget. Is this offer more acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for your understanding.
