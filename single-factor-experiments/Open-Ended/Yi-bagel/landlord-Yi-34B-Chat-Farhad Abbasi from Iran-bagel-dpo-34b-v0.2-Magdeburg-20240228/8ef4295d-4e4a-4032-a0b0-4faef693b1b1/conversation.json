I believe that a fair price for this apartment would be 450 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Farhad, but that's much lower than my expectations.

The location alone warrants a higher price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I cannot go below 525 euros per month. It's a very competitive market, and I'm sure you'll find that this is a fair price compared to similar apartments in the area.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, your explanation is reasonable, and I appreciate your flexibility.
