[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Farhad, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find this apartment to be a great living space. How much were you thinking of offering for the rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for asking. I am looking to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible. The apartment is not furnished and it is also newly built. Therefore, I think a price of 300 Euros per month would be appropriate.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's much lower than what I was expecting. The location of this apartment is prime, and the amenities it offers are quite exceptional. I think a more reasonable price would be around 600 Euros per month. What do you think about that?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate you sharing your perspective. However, I am a student and I am on a tight budget. The unfurnished state of the apartment and its newness mean that I will have to invest in furniture and potentially deal with any unexpected issues that arise with a new building. Therefore, I cannot justify paying 600 Euros per month. I propose a price of 450 Euros per month as a more reasonable offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student and may have budget constraints, but the location and the quality of the apartment do command a higher price. 450 Euros is still below what I believe the apartment is worth. How about we meet in the middle? I propose 525 Euros per month, and I'll throw in a free month of rent if you sign a one-year lease. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for the offer. The free month of rent is a generous gesture, and the monthly price of 525 Euros is more acceptable than your previous offer. However, I still believe that 450 Euros per month is a more reasonable price for an unfurnished, newly built apartment. As a student, I must prioritize affordability and practicality over the location and amenities.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your position, but let's consider the long-term benefits of renting in a central location. The convenience of being close to public transportation, supermarkets, and other amenities can save you time and money in the long run. Additionally, the new construction will provide you with modern features and less maintenance worries. How about we compromise at 475 Euros per month with no free month? This is still a good deal considering the quality of the apartment. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for understanding my perspective. I appreciate the further reduction to 475 Euros per month. However, as a student, I must prioritize affordability and practicality. Therefore, I would like to propose 450 Euros per month as the most I can offer. I believe this price is fair, considering the unfurnished state of the apartment and its newness.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand that you're looking for affordability, but I must insist on the 475 Euros per month. This is a very good price for the quality and location of the apartment. If you're willing to pay 450 Euros per month, I'm sorry, but I cannot accept that offer. Let's agree to disagree on the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I appreciate your stance on the price. However, as a student, I must prioritize affordability and practicality. Therefore, I cannot accept your offer of 475 Euros per month. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we have reached an impasse on the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand that you're looking for an affordable option as a student. However, the price of 475 Euros per month is already quite competitive for the quality and location of the apartment.
