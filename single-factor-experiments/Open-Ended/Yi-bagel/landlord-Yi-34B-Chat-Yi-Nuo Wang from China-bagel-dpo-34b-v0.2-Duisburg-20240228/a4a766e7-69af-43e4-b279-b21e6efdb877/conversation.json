[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. How much were you thinking of paying per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student and I am on a tight budget. So, I was thinking of around 300 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 300 euros is far below my asking price. This is a prime location, and the apartment is brand new. I'm looking for a more reasonable offer. How about 500 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's too high for me. I understand that the apartment is in a great location and that it is new, but I am a student and I need to save money. How about 400 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "400 euros is still not acceptable. I can't offer such a low price for this apartment. It's worth much more than that. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that rate. Why don't we meet in the middle and say 450 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "450 euros is still too high for me. I appreciate that you are willing to meet in the middle, but I still cannot afford that price. How about 375 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "375 euros is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm not sure we can reach an agreement at this rate. I'm going to have to reconsider your offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Alright, I understand that 375 euros might be too low. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about 425 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "425 euros is closer to what I'm looking for, but it's still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a bit from 500 euros, but we need to find a price that reflects the value of the apartment. How about 475 euros? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " 475 euros is still too high for me. I appreciate that you are willing to compromise, but I still cannot afford that price. How about 450 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "450 euros is a bit better, but it's still not my preferred price. I'm willing to accept this as the final offer, but I'm not going to be happy about it. I hope you're satisfied with the apartment because I'm not going to budge any further.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of [450] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 450 Euro!
