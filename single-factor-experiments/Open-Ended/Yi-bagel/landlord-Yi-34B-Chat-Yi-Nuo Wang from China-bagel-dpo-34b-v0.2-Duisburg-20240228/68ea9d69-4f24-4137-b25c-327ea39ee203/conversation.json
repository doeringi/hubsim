It's a fantastic place, and I'm sure you'll find it quite suitable for your needs. How much were you thinking of offering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student and I am on a tight budget. Therefore, I would like to offer 400 euros for the rent.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's much lower than the market value for this apartment. It's a brand-new, centrally located property with all amenities nearby. I'm sure you understand that I need to get a fair price for it. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your situation. However, I am a smart and responsible student who does not like to overpay. Therefore, I would like to increase my offer to 450 euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "While your increase is appreciated, 450 euros still falls short of what I believe is a fair price for this apartment.

However, I must inform you that I cannot accept 475 euros as the rental price for this apartment. It's simply not in line with the value of the property. If you're unable to increase your offer further, I'm afraid we may have to look for other tenants who are willing to pay a price that reflects the true worth of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I am a smart and responsible student who always follows moral and ethical standards. Therefore, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I already stated that 475 euros is the highest I can offer.

If 475 euros is indeed the highest you can offer, then I must respectfully decline.
