[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Wang, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment in Munich to be quite comfortable and convenient. Regarding the rental price, I'm open to discussing a fair market rate that reflects the quality of the property. What did you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Let's start with 800 Euros per month. Considering it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, this price is quite reasonable. I am sure you understand that the location and condition of the apartment make it worth the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Mr. Wang, and I understand that you're considering the location and condition of the apartment. However, I believe that the price can be negotiated to better reflect the value of the property.

I understand your reasoning, but I must respectfully disagree.

This price strikes a balance between the features you mentioned and the current condition of the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your stance, Mr. Schmidt. However, I must insist that 800 Euros per month is the lowest I can go, considering the competitive market and the amenities provided by the location.

Would you be willing to meet at this price to finalize the agreement?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your persistence, Mr. Wang. However, I must maintain the 850 Euros per month price to ensure the profitability of my investment. If you can accept this price, we can proceed with the rental agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot agree to that price. The apartment's location and the potential for future value appreciation are important to me, and I'm not willing to compromise on the price. I think it's best if we terminate the negotiation at this point.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mr. Wang. If you have no objection, let's terminate the negotiation. I wish you the best of luck in your future apartment search. 'TERMINATE'", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
