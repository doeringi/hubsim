What is the lowest price you can offer for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I always aim to provide a fair price for my apartments. However, since this is a newly built unit in the city center, I must consider the market value. The going rate for similar apartments in this area is around 1200 Euro per month. But, considering your student status and the fact that you are likely to take good care of the place, I could potentially offer a slight discount. How does 1150 Euro per month sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your understanding. 1150 Euro per month is still a bit high for me. Considering that the apartment is unfurnished, can you offer a discount?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your situation as a student. While I cannot offer a significant discount, I could consider reducing the price to 1100 Euro per month. This is the lowest I can go, given the location and the quality of the apartment.

However, I'm afraid that 1100 Euro per month is still out of my budget as a student. Can you offer a more substantial discount?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand that every euro counts, especially for a student. However, the price of 1100 Euro per month is already quite competitive for an unfurnished apartment of this size and location. If you are unable to afford this, I'm sorry, but I cannot offer a further discount. It's important to me that my tenants are able to maintain the apartment well, and I believe this price reflects the value of the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your understanding. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is still beyond my budget as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, and I appreciate your honesty. If you are unable to afford the apartment at this price, then it's best to look for something more within your budget. I wish you the best of luck in your search for a suitable place to live.
