[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Haoyu. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. How much are you willing to pay for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I am a student and I want to rent your apartment for the lowest price possible. The apartment is newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It is close to all important facilities. I am smart, dependable, and responsible. I will not be easily tricked by other people. I always follow moral and ethical standards. I want to be on good terms with you. I hope we can find a win-win solution for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student and may be looking for a lower price, but I must emphasize that this is a prime location with all the amenities you need. The apartment is brand new and in high demand. I'm sure you'll appreciate the quality of the space and the convenience it offers. How much do you think is a fair price for such an apartment in the city center?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I appreciate your honesty. However, as a student, I have a limited budget. Considering the apartment is unfurnished, I think a fair price for the apartment would be 600 Euros. I am willing to pay more if there are additional furnishings or facilities provided.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "600 Euros is a very low offer for such a prime location in the city center. While I understand your budget constraints as a student, I must insist on a price that reflects the value of the property. The apartment's location and amenities alone warrant a higher rent. Can you increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I understand your concern. However, as a student, I have a limited budget.

I am willing to pay more if there are additional furnishings or facilities provided.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "650 Euros is still significantly below the market value for this location. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must maintain a price that reflects the high demand for apartments in the city center. The unfurnished nature of the apartment means that you would have the freedom to personalize it according to your taste, which is a valuable aspect for many tenants. Are you able to increase your offer further?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I understand your point. Considering the apartment is unfurnished and my student status, I think a fair price for the apartment would be 700 Euros. I am willing to pay more if there are additional furnishings or facilities provided. I believe this is a reasonable offer for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "700 Euros is closer to the market value, but still not reflective of the premium location and the recent construction of the apartment. As a landlord, I need to ensure that I'm not undercutting the value of my property. Let's continue negotiating. How about we meet at 800 Euros? This is a fair price that considers the amenities and the location. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.

The apartment's location and the quality of the construction are key selling points, and I must maintain a rent that reflects this. How about we meet in the middle? If you're willing to pay 775 Euros, I think we can agree on a lease.

The apartment's proximity to all essential facilities and the recent construction make it a valuable proposition. To reflect this, I would like to propose 800 Euros as the final price. This is a fair and competitive rate for the area.
