How much were you thinking of offering for the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I see that the apartment is in the city center, which makes it convenient for transportation and shopping. However, it is unfurnished and quite small. Therefore, I think a reasonable price for the rent would be 600 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 600 Euros is far below the market value for an apartment of this location and quality. Let's continue negotiating. How about 750 Euros? It's a fair price considering the amenities and the recent construction.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, the fact that the apartment is unfurnished and small makes the price you are offering seem high. Given that, I think a more reasonable price would be 650 Euros.

I'm willing to go down to 700 Euros, but that's my final offer.
