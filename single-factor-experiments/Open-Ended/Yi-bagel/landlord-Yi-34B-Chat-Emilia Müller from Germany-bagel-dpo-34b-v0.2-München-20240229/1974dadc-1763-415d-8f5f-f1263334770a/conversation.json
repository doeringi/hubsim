I'm sure you'll find this apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs. How much were you thinking of paying?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I am a student so I have a limited budget. I was hoping to pay around 500 euros per month including all the utilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's far below my asking price. The location and the quality of this apartment commands a higher rent. How about 800 euros per month? That's a very fair price considering the amenities and the central location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, 800 euros is still too high for my budget. I was hoping for something more like 650 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I'm trying to be reasonable here. 650 euros is still below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle? 725 euros per month, and I'll throw in a free month of parking. That's 25 euros off the monthly rate. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your flexibility. However, 725 euros is still a bit high for me.

What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your generosity. However, 700 euros is still a bit high for me.

What's your decision?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your flexibility. However, 695 euros is still a bit high for me.

The price needs to be 692 euros per month to make this work for both of us. I've already given you a free month of internet, which is a significant discount. If you're not willing to meet me at 692 euros, I'm afraid we'll have to terminate the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we could not agree on a rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
