I'm sure you'll find the apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much were you thinking of paying for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student and I am on a tight budget. So I was thinking of 400 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's quite low for the location and the amenities the apartment offers. I'm sure you understand that I need to cover my expenses and make a reasonable profit. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Of course, I understand that you need to make a profit. How about 450 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hmm, 450 euros is still below my expectations. The apartment is brand new and in a prime location, which justifies a higher rent. Can you go a bit higher? Perhaps 500 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood. The apartment is indeed in a great location. How about 475 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but 475 euros is still not quite what I'm looking for. Let's aim for a number that reflects the quality of the apartment and the investment I've made. How about 550 euros? It's a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I see. 550 euros is quite high for me as a student. What about 500 euros? This would be a fair compromise, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "500 euros is more like it. I'm willing to accept this price, given your student status. We have a deal at 500 euros per month. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
