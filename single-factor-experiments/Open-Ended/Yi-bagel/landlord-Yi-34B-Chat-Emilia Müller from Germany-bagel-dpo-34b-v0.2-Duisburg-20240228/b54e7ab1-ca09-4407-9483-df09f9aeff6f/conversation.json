I'm sure you'll find my apartment in Duisburg to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. Regarding the rental price, I'm open to discussing a fair and market-appropriate amount. How does 1,200 Euro per month sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is too expensive for me. I am a student and I don't have that much money. I understand that the apartment is nice, but I cannot afford that price. I am willing to pay 800 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 800 Euro per month is below my asking price. The location and quality of the apartment justify a higher rent. How about we meet in the middle? 1,000 Euro per month would be a more reasonable and fair price, in my opinion. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is still a lot of money for me. I am willing to make some concessions to lower the rent. For example, I am a responsible tenant. I will pay the rent on time and maintain the apartment well. I am also willing to sign a two-year lease. How about 900 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to commit to a long-term lease and your promise to maintain the apartment well. However, 900 Euro per month is still below my asking price. Let's consider the amenities and the prime location of the apartment. It's in the city center, close to public transportation and amenities. The building is new and of high quality. I'm looking for a rent that reflects these attributes. How about 950 Euro per month? This would be a fair compromise, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my offer. I understand that the apartment is of high quality and has a good location. However, I am a student and I simply cannot afford more than 900 Euro per month.

However, I must insist on a rent that reflects the value of the property. 950 Euro per month is the lowest I can go, given the amenities and location. This would be a fair compromise, in my opinion.
