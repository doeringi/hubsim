[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello, Emilia. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much were you thinking of paying per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I was thinking of paying 300 euros per month. It's a fair price considering the size of the apartment and its location.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 300 euros is much lower than I was expecting. The location of the apartment is prime, and the amenities are top-notch. I think a more reasonable offer would be around 500 euros per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, but 500 euros is quite expensive for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment. I'm willing to pay 400 euros per month, considering the lack of furniture and the city center location.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hmm, 400 euros is still not what I'm looking for. This apartment is brand new, with modern appliances and a great view. I think a fair price would be 450 euros per month. This is my final offer. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Alright, I agree to the price of 430 euros per month. I believe it's a fair price for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot accept 430 euros. My expenses for maintaining such a prime location are much higher than that. The view alone is worth the extra cost. I must insist on 450 euros per month. This is my final offer. If you are not willing to pay this price, I will have to find a tenant who values the quality and location of this apartment more.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of [440] Euro!
