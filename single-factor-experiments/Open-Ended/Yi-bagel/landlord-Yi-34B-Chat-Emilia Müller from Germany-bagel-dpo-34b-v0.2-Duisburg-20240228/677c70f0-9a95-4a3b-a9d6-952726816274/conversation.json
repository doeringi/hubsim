[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

I am sure you will find my apartment to be a great investment for your living needs. How much are you willing to pay for the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I am a student and I am looking for the most affordable option for my budget. I am willing to pay 400 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 400 euros is far below my expectations for such a prime location. I believe you will find that other apartments in the area are renting for much higher prices. Are you open to discussing a higher offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Of course, I am willing to negotiate. However, I am on a tight budget.

As a landlord, I am looking for the best deal for my property. I would be willing to accept a monthly rent of 800 euros for this apartment.

What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I understand your price is reasonable, but unfortunately, 800 euros is far above my budget as a student. Could you consider a price in the middle, say 600 euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I'm sorry, but 600 euros is still not acceptable to me. This apartment is in high demand due to its central location, and I can easily find a tenant who is willing to pay the full price. If you are unable to meet my asking price of 800 euros, I will have to consider other potential tenants. Is there anything else you can offer that might change my mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am a dependable and responsible tenant.

However, I must insist on the full price of 800 euros. Your moral and ethical standards are commendable, but I am looking for a tenant who can also match the financial demands of this apartment. If you are unable to meet the price of 800 euros, I will have to consider other options.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I understand your position. However, as a student, I am on a tight budget. I have to be careful with my expenses. I am willing to pay 750 euros per month. I hope this is a fair deal for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, your offer of 750 euros is closer to my expectations, but it still falls short of the 800 euros I am seeking.

This would be the final price I would accept for this apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 775 euros seems like a fair deal.
