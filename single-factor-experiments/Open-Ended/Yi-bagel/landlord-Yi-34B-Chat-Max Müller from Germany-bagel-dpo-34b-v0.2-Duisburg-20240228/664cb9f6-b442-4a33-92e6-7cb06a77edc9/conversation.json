The apartment is brand new and in the heart of the city, close to all amenities. I'm looking for a tenant who can appreciate the value of this property. How about 700 euros per month? It's a more reasonable offer, considering the quality and location of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a big difference. Let's meet halfway.

However, I must insist on 650 euros per month. This is the lowest I can go for such a prime location.
