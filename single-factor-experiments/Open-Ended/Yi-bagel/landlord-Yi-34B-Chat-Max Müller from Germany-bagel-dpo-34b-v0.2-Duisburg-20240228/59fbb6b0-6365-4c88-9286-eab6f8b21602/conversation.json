[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for coming, Mr. M\u00fcller. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. So, what price were you thinking of for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I saw similar apartments in the city center with a rent of 600 euros. But they were not as modern and well-located as this one. So, I propose a rent of 650 euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hmm, 650 euros is an interesting offer, but I believe this apartment deserves a higher price. It's brand new, with the latest amenities, and the location is prime. I'm looking for something closer to 750 euros. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a high price, considering the current market situation. I think 680 euros would be more reasonable. It's a good middle ground between your initial offer and my proposal.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your counter-offer, but I must insist on the quality and location of this apartment. 700 euros would be the absolute lowest I could accept, given the investment I've made in this property. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, but 700 euros is still quite high for me. I propose 690 euros as a compromise. That's just 10 euros more than my last offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot go below 700 euros. This apartment is a gem, and I'm confident in its value. If you're not willing to meet at 700 euros, I'm afraid we may have to reconsider our negotiations.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I feel that 700 euros is too high for this apartment. I hope you find a suitable tenant who appreciates the value of the apartment as you do.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Mr. M\u00fcller.
