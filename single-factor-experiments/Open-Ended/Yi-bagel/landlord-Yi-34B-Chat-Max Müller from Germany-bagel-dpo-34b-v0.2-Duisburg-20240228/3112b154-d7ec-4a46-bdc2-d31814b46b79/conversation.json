[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg.

I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite comfortable and ideally located for your needs. How much were you thinking of offering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I am a student and I am looking for a place with the lowest price possible. I would offer 300 Euro per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's far below my expectations. My apartment is brand new and in the city center, which commands a higher price. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Okay, I could increase it a bit. How about 400 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "While 400 Euro is more in line with what I had in mind, I still believe my apartment is worth more, considering its location and amenities. Can you go a bit higher?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Alright, I could offer 450 Euro per month. I think this is a fair price for a student like me.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your budget constraints as a student, but I must insist that my apartment is worth more. Can you offer me 500 Euro per month? This would be a fair deal for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a big increase. I am not sure if I can afford that as a student. I could offer 475 Euro per month. This is the highest I can afford right now.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your effort, but I'm sorry, 475 Euro is still not enough for me to consider renting my apartment to you. I'm looking for a tenant who can appreciate the value of this property. If you're unable to meet my asking price, I'm not sure we can proceed with the rental agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I cannot afford the price you are asking for.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Max. If you're unable to meet my asking price, then I'm afraid we cannot proceed with the rental agreement.
