I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient. How much are you willing to pay for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, the apartment is indeed very nice and the location is ideal. Considering it's an unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, I believe 500 Euros per month would be a fair price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 Euros is much less than I was expecting. The apartment is brand new and in such a prime location. I think a more reasonable offer would be around 800 Euros per month. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood, Mr. Schmidt. Considering the quality of the apartment and its location, I agree to the price of 700 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 700 Euros is still not acceptable to me.

However, considering my budget and the market rate for similar apartments, I agree to the price of 800 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 800 Euros is not what I'm looking for. I'm trying to find a tenant who can appreciate the quality and the location of the apartment. Let's say 1100 Euros per month, and that's my final offer. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for the offer, Mr. Schmidt. However, I must decline due to my budget constraints. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price exceeds my budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your budget concerns, but I'm looking for a tenant who can afford to pay a fair price for the apartment.
