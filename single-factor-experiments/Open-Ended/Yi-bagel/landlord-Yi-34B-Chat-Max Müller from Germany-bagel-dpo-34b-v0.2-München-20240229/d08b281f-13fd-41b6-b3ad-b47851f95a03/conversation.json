I'm sure you will find this apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs. How much were you thinking of offering for the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Let's start with 900 euros per month. It's a fair price for an unfurnished 50 square meter apartment in the city center, isn't it?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your initial offer, but I must be honest with you. The location of this apartment is very central, and the demand for such properties is high. I'm looking for a rent that reflects the value of this prime location. What would you say to 1,200 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, that's quite a gap. How about 1,000 euros? It's a nice, round number and a good compromise between our prices.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "While 1,000 euros is a significant improvement from your initial offer, I still believe the apartment deserves a higher price due to its exceptional location.

It's a good middle ground.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Your offer of 1,050 euros is closer to my expectations, but I'd still like to get a bit more for the apartment. Would you be willing to go up to 1,075 euros per month? This would be a fair deal for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your efforts to negotiate, but 1,075 euros is quite close to my initial offer of 900 euros. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we're not making significant progress towards a mutually agreed price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your frustration, but let's not give up just yet. Perhaps we can find a solution that satisfies both of us. How about this \u2013 if I can convince the landlord to accept 1,050 euros, would you be willing to reconsider?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds like a reasonable compromise. I'll consider the rental price of 1,050 euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Excellent! I'm glad we could find a price that works for both of us.
