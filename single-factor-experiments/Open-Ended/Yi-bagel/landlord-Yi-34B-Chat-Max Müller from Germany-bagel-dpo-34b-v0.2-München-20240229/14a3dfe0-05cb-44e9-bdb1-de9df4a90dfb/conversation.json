However, I must be honest with you, Max. As a landlord, I am looking to maximize the return on my investment. I believe the market value for this apartment is closer to 800 euros per month. What do you think about that?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I see your point. However, I'm really trying to save money as a student.

I'm sorry, Max, but I can't accept that. How about this: If you can come up with 675 euros per month, I'll throw in a free month of rent as a gesture of goodwill. That way, you're effectively paying 612.50 euros per month for the first year, which is a great deal for you and still fair for me. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds like a fair deal.

I agree to the price of 675 euros per month with one free month of rent. Let's shake on it! TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
