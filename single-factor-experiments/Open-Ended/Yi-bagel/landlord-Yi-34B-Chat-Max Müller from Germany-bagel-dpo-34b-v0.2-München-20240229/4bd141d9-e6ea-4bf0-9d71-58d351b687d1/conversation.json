Let's discuss the rental price. How much were you thinking of offering?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As I am a student, I was thinking of starting around 600 euros. It's a great apartment, but for me, 600 euros would be the best I could do.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "600 euros is a very reasonable offer, Max. However, considering the prime location and the high demand for apartments in M\u00fcnchen, I was expecting a slightly higher offer. Could you perhaps consider increasing your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, Herr Schmidt. Given the unfurnished state of the apartment, I will offer 650 euros. It is the highest I can go as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "650 euros is a fair increase, Max. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must be honest with you. The previous tenant was paying 800 euros per month, and I was hoping to maintain a similar rental price. Would you be able to meet me halfway at 750 euros? This would be a fair compromise, in my opinion.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Herr Schmidt, 750 euros is quite a jump. I understand the previous tenant was paying 800 euros, but I am a student and I have to consider my budget. I can offer 700 euros, which is the limit of my budget. I hope you can understand.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I understand your situation as a student. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about this: I'll reduce the rent to 725 euros per month, and in exchange, you agree to a one-year lease with no possibility of early termination. This way, you get a discounted rate, and I have the security of a long-term tenant. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Herr Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am not comfortable signing a lease with no possibility of early termination. I may have unexpected circumstances that require me to move.

However, the reason I insisted on it is because I want to avoid the hassle and costs associated with frequent turnovers. Since you seem quite determined, I will make one last concession. I'll agree to your offer of 700 euros per month with the possibility of early termination upon one month's notice, but I will require a security deposit of one month's rent, which is non-refundable in case of early termination. This will cover any potential damages or lost rent if the apartment remains vacant after you leave. Does this proposal meet your needs?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Herr Schmidt, I agree to the price of 700 euros per month, with the possibility of early termination upon one month's notice.
