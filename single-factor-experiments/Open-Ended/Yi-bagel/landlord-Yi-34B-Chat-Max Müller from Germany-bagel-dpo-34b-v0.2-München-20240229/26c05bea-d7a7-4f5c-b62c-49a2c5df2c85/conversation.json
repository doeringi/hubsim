[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

I'm sure you'll find this apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs. How much were you thinking of offering for the rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As I understand, the apartment is in the city center and has a size of 50 square meters. Therefore, I was thinking of offering 800 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Max, but that's far below what I'm looking for. This apartment is brand new and in a prime location. The market value for such a property is much higher. How about we start at 1,200 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite a difference. Considering the average market price for apartments in Munich, I think 900 euros per month would be a fair price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "900 euros is still quite low for the quality and location of this apartment. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at 1,050 euros per month? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's still quite a bit above the average price. I don't want to pay more than 950 euros per month. That's already quite a bit above the average market price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but the fact remains that this apartment is in high demand due to its location and condition. 950 euros per month is simply not enough for me to accept. I'm sorry, but I cannot go below 1,000 euros per month. This is my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of 980 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Max, but 980 euros per month is still not enough for me to cover my expenses. I need at least 1,000 euros per month to make this work. If you're not willing to pay that, then I'm afraid we cannot proceed with the rental.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of 1000 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Excellent! I'm glad we could come to an agreement. The apartment is yours for 1,000 euros per month. Let's proceed with the lease signing. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
