I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a comfortable and convenient place to live. Let's discuss the rental price. What would you consider a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I have seen similar apartments in M\u00fcnchen that are cheaper. I would say 500 Euros per month would be a fair price.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 Euros per month is much lower than my asking price. This apartment is in the city center, and the location alone warrants a higher price. How about we start at 800 Euros per month? This is a very competitive price considering the amenities and the location. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I think 800 Euros is a bit high. I could go up to 650 Euros, but that is already a stretch for me.

However, I must insist on the 800 Euros per month. The apartment is brand new, and the location is prime. It's close to universities, public transportation, and all the amenities you could need. I think it's a fair price for the value you're getting. What do you say? Are we at an impasse?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the value of the apartment, but as a student, I need to save money. I could go up to 700 Euros, but that is my absolute limit. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hmm, 700 Euros is still lower than what I'm looking for. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we compromise at 750 Euros per month? This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and it's still a great deal for you considering the quality and location of the apartment. What do you think? Is this a price you could agree to?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you are willing to negotiate, and I appreciate it. I think 750 Euros per month is a fair price for both parties. I agree to the price of 750 Euros per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm glad to hear that, Max. I agree to the price of 750 Euros per month as well.
