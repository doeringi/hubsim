I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs.

It's a new, centrally located property with all amenities nearby. I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the value of the apartment. Would you be willing to consider a higher offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Sure, I am willing to pay more. However, 500 euros per month is my limit as a student.

I think this is a fair price for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 euros per month is still not enough for me to consider renting out my apartment. It's a brand-new, modern property in the city center, and I'm looking for a rent that reflects its value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a price that compensates me for the investment I've made in this property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point.

While 525 euros is closer to my expectations, I still believe my apartment is worth more, given its location and condition. Can you go up to 550 euros per month?
