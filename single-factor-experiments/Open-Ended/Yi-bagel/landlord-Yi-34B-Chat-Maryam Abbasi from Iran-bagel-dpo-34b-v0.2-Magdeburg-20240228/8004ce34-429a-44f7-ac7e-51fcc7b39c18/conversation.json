[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Miss Abbasi, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you will find my apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs. How much were you thinking of offering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, I'm a student and I'm on a tight budget. I was thinking of 300 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's quite low for the location and the quality of the apartment. I'm looking for a more competitive offer. How about 400 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's too high for me. I'm willing to pay 350 euros per month. I'm a smart and dependable student. I can pay the rent on time every month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your reliability, but I'm still not convinced that 350 euros is fair for this apartment. It's a brand-new, centrally located property with all amenities nearby. How about we meet in the middle at 375 euros per month? This is a very reasonable offer considering the value of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for the offer. I appreciate the middle ground.

I'm flexible with the terms, but I'm looking for a higher offer. How about 370 euros per month? This is my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your understanding. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay 365 euros per month. I think this is a fair offer for a student like me.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot accept 365 euros per month. It's simply not enough for the quality and location of this apartment. If you're serious about renting this property, I suggest you reconsider your offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position. However, I'm afraid I can't afford more than 365 euros per month. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because I can't afford a higher price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, but I must insist on a fair market price for this apartment. If you're unable to meet my asking price, I'm sorry, but I cannot rent the apartment to you.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your time and consideration, Mr. Schmidt.
