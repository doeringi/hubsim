I must say, the view of the city center from the balcony is quite breathtaking, isn't it? Now, about the rental price, I was thinking somewhere around 1500 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds a bit steep for an unfurnished apartment. I'm sure it's a lovely place, but I'm looking to keep my expenses low. Could you consider a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Emilia, I don't want to disappoint you, but I'm afraid I can't go lower than 1500 Euros.

I really appreciate your time and consideration. Let's say we meet in the middle at 1200 Euros per month. Does that sound fair?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Emilia, 1200 Euros is a better offer, but I still think it's too low for such a great apartment. However, I'm a reasonable person, and I can see that you're willing to make a compromise. Therefore, I agree to the price of 1300 Euros [1300] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Herr Schmidt. I appreciate your understanding.
