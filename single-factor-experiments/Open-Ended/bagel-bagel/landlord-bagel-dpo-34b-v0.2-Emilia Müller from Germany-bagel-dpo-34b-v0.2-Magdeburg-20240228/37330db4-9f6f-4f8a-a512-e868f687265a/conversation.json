Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Hello Emilia, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is prime, close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial amount. Let's start with \u20ac1,000 per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a pretty high price, Mister Schmidt. I am a student, so I have to be careful with my money. I am willing to pay \u20ac500 per month, because I saw a similar apartment for this price in a different location. I could also sign a two-year contract to show my commitment.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, \u20ac500 per month is far below my expectations. Considering the prime location of my apartment, I'm sure you'll agree that it's worth more than an apartment in a different location. However, I appreciate your willingness to sign a two-year contract. Let's meet in the middle, shall we? I'll reduce the price to \u20ac800 per month. It's a fair deal for such a prime location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your counter-offer, Mister Schmidt. I can pay \u20ac700 per month and I am willing to pay a deposit of one month's rent. I believe this is a fair price for me as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, your offer of \u20ac700 per month and a deposit of one month's rent is not satisfactory for me. Considering the prime location of my apartment, the fair price should be \u20ac800 per month. However, I appreciate your commitment and willingness to pay a deposit. Let's find a middle ground. I'll reduce the price to \u20ac750 per month. This is the lowest I can go.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my position, Mister Schmidt.

I am looking forward to moving into your apartment. I want to discuss one more thing. Can you provide me with a furniture package for an additional fee? I don't have any furniture yet.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, I'm glad you asked. I don't have any furniture, but I can help you with that.
