[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a fair deal that suits both of us. How much did you have in mind? Remember, this is a prime location in the city center, close to all important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's correct. The unfurnished one-bedroom apartment is very modern and it has a size of 50 square meters. The location is perfect. I am a student and I am looking for a long-term lease. I am thinking about 550 euros per month including all costs.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, a student like you should know how to negotiate better. The place is in the city center and has all the amenities you might need. I think 550 euros is too low for such a prime location. Let's split the difference and say 700 euros. That's a fair offer, considering the location and amenities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's not acceptable for me. The apartment is not furnished and I have to pay for the internet and electricity. 600 euros would be a more reasonable price.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, you're trying to play the pity card with me. I'm not falling for it. The apartment is unfurnished, yes, but that's not my problem. It's in the city center and close to all amenities. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but 600 euros is too low. Let's say 650 euros, and that's my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 625 euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is not satisfactory to me. I set a limit of 650 euros, and you did not meet that price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of 650 euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of [650] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
