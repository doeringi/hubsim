I must say, it's a fantastic apartment in the city center, and I'm sure you'll find it very convenient. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a fair and reasonable amount that suits both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I see. How about we start with a price of 800 euros per month?\n[Question]", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "That's a very low price for such a great apartment in the city center. I could easily find someone who is willing to pay more. How about we start with 1200 euros per month? That seems more reasonable to me.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, but considering the apartment is unfurnished, I think 800 euros is a fair price.
