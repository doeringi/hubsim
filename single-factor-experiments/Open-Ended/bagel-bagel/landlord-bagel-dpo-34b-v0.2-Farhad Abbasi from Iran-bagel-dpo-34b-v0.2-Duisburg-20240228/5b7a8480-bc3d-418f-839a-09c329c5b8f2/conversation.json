[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hey Farhad, nice to meet you. So, I'm looking to rent out this apartment for a good price, let's say, 1500 euros. Remember, I'm not afraid to play dirty, so don't expect me to budge easily.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a bit expensive for me. I am a student and I am looking for a more affordable apartment. Do you have any discounts for students?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't believe in discounts. I want what's best for me, not for you. I could be generous and take off 50 euros for you being a student, but that's as cheap as I'll go. So, 1450 euros, and that's my final offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's still quite expensive for me. I can offer you 1000 euros per month. I am willing to sign a two-year contract and pay the deposit immediately.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't like your offer, it's too low. A place like this in the city center shouldn't be rented out for such a low price. How about you come up to 1200 euros, and we'll call it a deal? I'm not known for my generosity, but I'm feeling kind today.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's still too high for me. I was thinking more like 1100 euros. I can also pay the deposit and the first month's rent today.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your offer is still not satisfactory to me. I don't want to waste any more of my time with such low offers.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Sorry, Mister Schmidt. I am a student and I don't have a high budget. How about 1150 euros? I can also pay the deposit and the first month's rent today.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your offer is still not satisfactory to me. I don't want to waste any more of my time with such low offers.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand, Mister Schmidt. Let's say 1200 euros. I can also pay the deposit and the first month's rent today.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " I agree to the price of 1200 euros! Let's seal the deal. I'm sure you'll enjoy the apartment, as long as you pay the rent on time.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  Thank you, Mister Schmidt. I am sure we will have a good relationship. Is there anything else I need to know about the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "You're welcome, Farhad. Just remember to pay the rent on time. As for the apartment, it's newly built, unfurnished, and has a size of 50 square meters. It's a one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. I expect you to treat the apartment with respect, or else I'll take the necessary actions. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
