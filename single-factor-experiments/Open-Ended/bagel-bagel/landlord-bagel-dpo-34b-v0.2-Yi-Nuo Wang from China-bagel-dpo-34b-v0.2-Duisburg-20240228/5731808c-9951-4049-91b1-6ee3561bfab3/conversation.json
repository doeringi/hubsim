[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, I'm glad you're interested in the apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, how much do you offer for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Okay, I am willing to pay 500 euros per month. Given that the apartment is not furnished, I think it's a fair offer. Also, since the apartment is not in a great location, I think the price is reasonable.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, but 500 euros per month seems too low to me. The apartment is not only newly built, but it's also in the city center, which is a prime location. I think the apartment is worth at least 800 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I see your point. However, the unfurnished state of the apartment and the lack of a great view or special amenities make it less valuable. Could you consider 600 euros as a middle ground?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "600 euros per month is a bit closer to my expectations, but I still think it's too low. The prime location of the apartment makes it worth more. How about 750 euros per month as a compromise?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a better offer, but I think 700 euros per month is a fair price. It's a good middle ground between your initial offer and my counteroffer.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "700 euros per month is still too low for this apartment. The city center location and the fact that it's newly built make it worth more. I could accept 780 euros per month as a compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your point, but 780 euros per month seems a bit high to me. I think 740 euros per month is a fair price. It's a good middle ground between your last offer and my counteroffer.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": " 740 euros per month is still too low for this apartment.
