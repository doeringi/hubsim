[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like supermarkets and public transportation. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial amount. Let's negotiate.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Schmidt. I am a student, so I have a limited budget. I will try my best to get the best price. I hope we can reach an agreement. How much is your initial price?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Well, considering the prime location and the excellent condition of the apartment, I would say a reasonable starting price would be \u20ac1,200. It's a bit steep, I know, but I'm sure you'll appreciate the value for money.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is quite expensive for me. In Germany, the rent cannot exceed 30% of a person's income. For me as a student, it would be impossible to pay such a high rent. Could you consider a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Well, Yi-Nuo Wang, I can consider a lower price, but I'm afraid \u20ac1,200 is already quite low considering the quality of the apartment and its location. However, I appreciate your situation. How about \u20ac1,100, which is a 100 euro discount? I believe it's a fair price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my situation. However, I think \u20ac1,100 is still too high for me. I have to pay for my studies and other expenses. Could you consider a price around \u20ac800? I think it's a reasonable price for a student apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Yi-Nuo Wang, but \u20ac800 is far below the market price for this apartment. I can't accept such a low price. I understand your financial situation as a student, but I also need to cover my costs as a landlord. If you insist on \u20ac800, I have to decline. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is far below the market value.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Mister Schmidt. However, I still hope we can find a middle ground. I will pay \u20ac1,100, but you have to help me with something. Could you provide me with a furniture package for the apartment? I don't have the money to buy furniture. In return, I will pay \u20ac1,100.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Yi-Nuo Wang, but the negotiation is not about providing furniture. It's about renting the apartment. I'm willing to rent it for \u20ac1,100, but I won't provide any furniture. If you agree to pay \u20ac1,100 for the apartment rental without any furniture package, I can agree to the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Mister Schmidt. I agree to the price of \u20ac1,100 Euro! I will rent the apartment from you.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of \u20ac1,100 Euro! Congratulations, Yi-Nuo Wang, you're the new tenant of my apartment. Let's proceed with the necessary paperwork to formalize our agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Great, Mister Schmidt. I will take care of the paperwork. Thank you for your time and for renting the apartment to me. I am looking forward to moving in.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "You're welcome, Yi-Nuo Wang.
