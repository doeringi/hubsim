[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Max M\u00fcller from Germany. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, I'm looking for a rent that truly appreciates the value of my apartment. Let's negotiate.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds great. I am a student and I am looking for an affordable apartment to rent. So, how about we start with a price of 600 Euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a laughable offer, Max. A student trying to haggle with me? I can tell you right away, you're going to need to offer much more than that.
