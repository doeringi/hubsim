Let's negotiate the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "The apartment is in the city center, and it's newly built. I think a price of 1,000 Euros per month is reasonable.", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a low price for such a prime location and new construction. I demand at least 1,500 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I can see your point, but the apartment is unfurnished and 50 square meters only.
