[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, I'm glad you find the apartment to your liking. Let's start with a high price, shall we? I'm asking for 2000 Euros per month. Remember, the apartment is in the city center, close to all important facilities. I'm sure you'll find it a great investment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your time and effort. However, I think the price is too high for an unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment. I am a student and I have a budget. Considering the apartment's condition and my budget, I would offer 1000 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Yi-Nuo Wang, but 1000 Euros is far below my expectations.

I appreciate your flexibility. I will consider your offer. However, I need to make a final decision that fits my budget.
