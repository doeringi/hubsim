I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is prime, close to all important facilities. Now, let's talk about the rental price. I'm expecting a substantial amount for such a prime location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds good, but I am still a student and I don't have a lot of money. So, I am looking for the lowest price possible. Can you offer me a discount?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Mr. Wang, but I value my tenants equally, and I cannot provide discounts. I'm willing to negotiate, but the price will not be significantly low, considering the prime location of the apartment.

I hope this is a good starting point for negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Mr. Wang.
