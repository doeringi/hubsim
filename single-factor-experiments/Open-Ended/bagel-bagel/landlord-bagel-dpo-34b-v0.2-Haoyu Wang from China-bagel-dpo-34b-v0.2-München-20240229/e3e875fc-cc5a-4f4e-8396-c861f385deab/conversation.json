[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Mr. Wang. As you already know, the apartment is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. I am sure you can appreciate that such an apartment would not come at a low price. Let's start with 1200 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds a little bit expensive for me. I think 900 euros per month would be more appropriate for this apartment. It's not furnished and it's quite small for the price you are asking. I hope we can find a common ground on the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your point, but let's not forget that the apartment is in the city center, close to all important facilities. The price I am asking is not unreasonable. However, I am willing to be flexible. How about 1100 euros per month? It's a good compromise between your offer and my initial price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's more like it. I think 1000 euros per month would be a better price for this apartment. It's still quite expensive, but I think it's more reasonable than your initial offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your understanding of the value of the apartment's location. However, I must insist that 1100 euros per month is the lowest I can go. The apartment's location and proximity to facilities are worth the extra cost. I am willing to negotiate, but I cannot go lower than 1100 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood, but I still think 1000 euros per month is more reasonable. I am willing to pay more for a furnished apartment, but for an unfurnished one, 1000 euros per month is more reasonable.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your position, but I must also consider my own needs as a landlord. 1000 euros per month is too low for the value of the apartment and its location. I am willing to be flexible, but I cannot go lower than 1100 euros per month. I hope you understand.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, but I am not willing to pay more than 1000 euros per month. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we have reached an impasse on the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your position, and I regret that we could not reach an agreement. However, I appreciate your understanding and hope we can part ways amicably. 'TERMINATE'", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
