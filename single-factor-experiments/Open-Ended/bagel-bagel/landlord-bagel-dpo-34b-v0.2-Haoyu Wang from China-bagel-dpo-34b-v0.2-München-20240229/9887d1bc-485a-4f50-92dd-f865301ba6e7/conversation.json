[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

I must say, the apartment is in high demand, and I'm sure we can find a price that suits both of us. Let's start with a price of \u20ac1,000 per month. Remember, I'm always open to reasonable offers.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That is a bit high for me, Mister Schmidt. Considering the apartment is unfurnished and I am a student, I believe it is not a student-friendly price.

However, the location of the apartment and its proximity to the city center are in high demand. Let's compromise at \u20ac850 per month. This should be a fair price, considering the apartment's premium location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your understanding, Mister Schmidt. However, I believe \u20ac850 is still quite high for an unfurnished apartment. Given that I am a student, I would like to propose \u20ac650 per month. I understand that this is a significant decrease, but I hope we can find a compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Mr. Wang, but \u20ac650 per month is far below my expectations.

This should be a fair price, considering the apartment's excellent location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for meeting me halfway, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate your understanding. However, I must be honest and say that \u20ac780 is still too high for me. I must find a price that fits within my budget as a student. I propose \u20ac700 per month.
