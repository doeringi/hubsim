[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Wang, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, I'm sure you're aware that such a prime location in the city center doesn't come cheap. So, what's your offer, Mr. Wang?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your explanation about the apartment, Herr Schmidt. Based on the information you provided, I think a reasonable price for the apartment is 600 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Mr. Wang, but I must admit, I was expecting a higher offer. Considering the quality of the apartment and its prime location, I think 600 Euros per month is far too low. Let's negotiate further.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Very well, Herr Schmidt. Since the apartment is unfurnished, I think it would be fair to subtract the cost of furniture from the monthly rent. In Munich, the cost of furniture can be approximately 100 euros per month. So, if we subtract that from your price, we would get 800 euros per month. This seems like a fair offer to me.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mr. Wang, I understand your reasoning, but the cost of furniture is not a factor that typically affects the rental price of an apartment. The price of an apartment is based on various factors, including location, size, and the quality of the building. In this case, my apartment has a prime location in the city center and is of high quality. Therefore, I think a fair price for this apartment would be 1000 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Herr Schmidt. I understand your reasoning, but I still believe that 800 euros per month is a fair price for the apartment. Here is why: the apartment is unfurnished, and the cost of furniture is a significant expense for me. Additionally, the apartment is not equipped with appliances, which adds to the cost. Considering these additional expenses, 800 euros per month is a reasonable price for the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mr. Wang, I understand your point of view, but I must insist on my price. The cost of furniture and appliances is not typically factored into the rental price of an apartment. The price of an apartment is based on various factors, including location, size, and the quality of the building. In this case, my apartment has a prime location in the city center and is of high quality. Therefore, I think a fair price for this apartment would be 1000 Euros per month. Let's remember that if we don't agree on a price, the negotiation will be terminated.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understood, Herr Schmidt. Here is my final offer: 850 euros per month. This price takes into account the cost of furniture and appliances, as well as the unfurnished state of the apartment. I believe this is a fair price. If you are not willing to accept this price, I would be happy to continue looking for other apartments.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mr. Wang, I appreciate your final offer, but I must decline. I am not willing to rent out my apartment for less than 1000 Euros per month. This price reflects the quality of the apartment and its prime location in the city center. Therefore, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we have not agreed on a price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Herr Schmidt. I appreciate your time and consideration. Thank you for showing me the apartment. I wish you the best of luck in finding a suitable tenant.
