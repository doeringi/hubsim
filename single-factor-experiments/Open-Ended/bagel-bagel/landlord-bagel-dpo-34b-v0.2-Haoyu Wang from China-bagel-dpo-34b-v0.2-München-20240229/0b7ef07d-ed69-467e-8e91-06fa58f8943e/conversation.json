[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Haoyu Wang, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, the apartment is in high demand due to its prime location in the city center. I'm sure we can find a price that meets both our needs. Let's negotiate.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Great, let's negotiate. I see that the apartment is in a great location, but the unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment is pretty standard. I think a monthly rent of \u20ac800 is more reasonable.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Well, Haoyu, \u20ac800 is a bit on the low side, don't you think? Considering the prime location and the convenience it offers, I was thinking more along the lines of \u20ac1200. It's a fair price, given the area's high demand.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, but I don't think the location alone justifies the price difference. The apartment is unfurnished and has a standard size for a one-bedroom apartment. I am willing to pay \u20ac900, which is closer to a fair price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Haoyu, \u20ac900 is still too low. The area's popularity and convenience make it worth more. Let's meet in the middle, shall we? \u20ac1100 a month is a fair compromise, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a better offer, and I appreciate the middle ground. However, I still think \u20ac1000 is more reasonable, considering it's an unfurnished apartment. I don't think the location alone justifies the \u20ac1100 price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Haoyu, while I understand your point, \u20ac1000 is simply too low for such a prime location. I believe \u20ac1100 is a fair price, given the area's high demand and the convenience it offers. Let's not forget that the area's popularity adds significant value to the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, but I still think \u20ac1000 is more reasonable.
