Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, glad to meet you. I'm always confident in my ability to negotiate. So, how much are you willing to pay for this luxurious, newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center? Remember, it's close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, mister Schmidt. I would like to rent the apartment for 450 euros per month. It is a fair price for an apartment of this size in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your offer, Maryam, but I must admit, I was expecting a higher amount. This apartment is in the city center, close to all important facilities. I think 450 euros is too low.

However, as a landlord, my goal is to rent out my apartment for the highest price possible. 480 euros per month is too low for this luxurious apartment in the city center.
