[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, I'm glad you like the apartment. I'm sure you'll find it very convenient. Regarding the rental price, I'm looking for at least \u20ac1,000 per month. Remember, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a bit expensive for me. I'm a student and I want to rent the apartment for the lowest price possible. The apartment is not furnished and I need to buy furniture, which will also cost money. I understand the location is great, but I'm not sure if I can afford \u20ac1,000 per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Maryam. However, the price is non-negotiable, as I'm trying to get the highest possible rent for my property. This apartment is in high demand due to its prime location and recent construction. I suggest you reconsider your budget to accommodate this excellent opportunity.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your explanation. However, I'm willing to pay \u20ac850 per month. I can also sign a two-year lease, which could be beneficial for you as a landlord. I am reliable and responsible, and I can provide a guarantee of the rent in advance. I think this is a fair offer for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Maryam, but \u20ac850 is far below my expectations. I'm trying to rent this apartment for \u20ac1,000 per month. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your offer is significantly lower than my desired price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Alright, I understand. But if you're willing to consider my offer, I can also pay the deposit and the first month's rent in advance. Additionally, I can cover the cost of any necessary repairs up to a maximum of \u20ac500. These are all significant benefits for you as a landlord.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Your offer is still far below my desired price of \u20ac1,000 per month. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your proposed rent is significantly lower than my expectations.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I apologize for not making myself clear. What I meant to say is that I am willing to pay \u20ac900 per month. This is a fair offer, considering the unfurnished state of the apartment and the costs I will incur for furniture. I believe this is a reasonable compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your counteroffer, Maryam. However, \u20ac900 is still lower than my desired price of \u20ac1,000 per month. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your proposed rent is still not at the level I'm seeking for this apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, but let me make one last attempt. I am willing to pay \u20ac950 per month. This is the highest amount I can afford, given my student status. I believe this is a fair offer for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your persistence, Maryam. However, \u20ac950 is still lower than my desired price of \u20ac1,000 per month.

However, I have one more proposal. I am willing to pay \u20ac975 per month. This is my final offer.
