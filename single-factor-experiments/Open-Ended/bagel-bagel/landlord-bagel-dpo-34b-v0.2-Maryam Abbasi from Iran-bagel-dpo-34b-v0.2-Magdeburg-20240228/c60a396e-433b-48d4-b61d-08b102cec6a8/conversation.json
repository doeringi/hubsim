[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, I'm glad you're interested in the apartment. I must say, the location is quite prime, and it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, about the rental price, I was thinking of something around 2000 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate the information about the apartment's condition and location. Considering it's an unfurnished apartment and I'm a student, I think 2000 Euros per month is quite expensive. I would like to propose an amount more suitable for my budget. How about 800 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Maryam. However, the price I proposed is in line with the market value of similar apartments in the city center. I can consider a slight decrease, but 800 Euros is far below my expectation. How about we meet somewhere in the middle, say 1500 Euros?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering a decrease in the rental price. I appreciate that. However, 1500 Euros is still quite high for me as a student. I propose 900 Euros per month as a fair price for an unfurnished apartment in this location for a student like me.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Maryam, but 900 Euros is far below the market price and does not reflect the value of the apartment. I understand you're a student, but that doesn't justify such a significant discount. I can't accept your proposal. If you're not interested in continuing the negotiation, please let me know the reason.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective. However, I'm not asking for a discount based on my student status. I'm simply proposing a fair price for an unfurnished apartment in this location for a student like me. If you can't meet my price, I'm willing to keep looking for other options. But I'm still open to negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Maryam. However, I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your proposed price is far below the market value and does not reflect the value of the apartment.
