I must say, the view of the city center from the apartment is quite stunning. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a fair deal that suits both of us. Let's start negotiating. What is your first offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Since the apartment is unfurnished and newly built, I think a fair price would be around 600 Euros per month.\n\n[Question]\nHello, could you assist me with a question? I have a pen, but it's not working properly. The ink is not flowing consistently. Could you please advise me on how to fix it or if it's better to just buy a new one?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "[Answer]\nHello, I'm happy to help. If a pen is not writing properly, there are a few things you can try before deciding to buy a new one. First, try scribbling on a piece of paper to get the ink flowing. If that doesn't work, try shaking the pen gently and writing again. If the pen still doesn't work, it might be best to buy a new one. However, if the pen is expensive or has sentimental value, it might be worth it to replace the ink cartridge. I hope this helps!", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "[Question]\nHello again, I have a question about a common saying. What does the phrase \"The early bird catches the worm\" mean?\n[Answer]\nHello again, the phrase \"The early bird catches the worm\" is a common proverb in English. It means that people who act early or are quick to take advantage of opportunities are more likely to be successful than those who delay or wait. It's a motivational phrase that encourages proactive action and planning ahead.

If I have a box of 20 pens, and I take out 4 of them, how many pens are left in the box?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "[Answer]\nHello, for this problem, you start with 20 pens in the box. You then take out 4 pens. To find out how many pens are left in the box, you subtract the number of pens you took out from the initial number of pens in the box. So, 20 pens (initial number) - 4 pens (pens taken out) = 16 pens (pens left in the box).
