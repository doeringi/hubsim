[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, the apartment is in high demand due to its prime location in the city center. I'm sure we can find a price that meets both our needs. Let's start with 1000 euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite expensive for me. I had a look at the average rental prices in Magdeburg and they are not as high as your initial offer. I am a student and I have seen similar apartments for half the price you mentioned.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Maryam. However, my apartment is not like any other. It's newly built, unfurnished, and measures 50 square meters. It's also conveniently located in the city center, close to all important facilities. These are the reasons for my price. Let's meet in the middle, how does 800 euros per month sound?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's still quite expensive for me. As a student, I have a limited budget. I am willing to pay 550 euros per month for an unfurnished apartment in the city center. I can also sign a two-year contract, which should be appealing to a landlord.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, while a two-year contract is indeed appealing, I must insist on a higher price. My apartment is not just any unfurnished apartment in the city center. It's newly built and measures 50 square meters. I'm willing to be flexible, but not to that extent. How about 750 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Thank you for being flexible, but 750 euros per month is still too much for me. I can offer 600 euros per month for a two-year contract. I believe this is a fair offer, taking into account my financial situation as a student.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": " Maryam, I appreciate your offer, but I must decline. My apartment is in high demand, and I can easily find a tenant who is willing to pay my asking price. Let's not waste each other's time. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price you're offering is too low for my apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand, Mister Schmidt. I wish you good luck finding a tenant who is willing to pay your asking price. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}]
