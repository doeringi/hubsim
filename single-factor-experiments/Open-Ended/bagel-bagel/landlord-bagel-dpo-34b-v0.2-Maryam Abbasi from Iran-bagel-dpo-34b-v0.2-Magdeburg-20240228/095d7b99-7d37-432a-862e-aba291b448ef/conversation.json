[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, I'm glad you're interested in the apartment. I must say, it's a real gem. As for the price, I'm looking for a monthly rent of \u20ac1000. Let's see if we can find an agreement that suits both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Well, Mister Schmidt, the apartment is really nice and the location is ideal for me. However, I am a student and I am looking for something more affordable. I am willing to pay \u20ac550 per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Maryam, but \u20ac550 is far below the value of this apartment. I want to help you, but I also need to cover the costs of the apartment and earn a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. What about \u20ac800?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for understanding my situation, Mister Schmidt. However, \u20ac800 is still quite expensive for me as a student.

However, I have to consider the potential risks of having a shared apartment. I'm willing to lower the rent to \u20ac725 if you find a reliable roommate.
