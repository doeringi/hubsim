I must say, it's a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket and public transportation. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find a price that suits both of us. Let's start with 1000 euros per month. Remember, I'm always up for a bargain, but I do want to get the best deal for my property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for the offer. The apartment sounds like a great place to live. However, I'm a student and I'm looking for something more affordable. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Of course, Maryam. I understand that students are usually on a tight budget. How about we say... 850 euros per month? It's still a fair price for such a great apartment in the city center, and it leaves you some room in your budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for the counteroffer.
