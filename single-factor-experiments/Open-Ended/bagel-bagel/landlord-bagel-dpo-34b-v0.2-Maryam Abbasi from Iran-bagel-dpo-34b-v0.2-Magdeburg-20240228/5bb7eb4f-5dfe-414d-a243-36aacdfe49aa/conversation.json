[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam,\n\nI'm not interested in negotiating the price of the apartment. My goal is to rent it out for the highest price possible. Therefore, let's start with a price that reflects the quality of the apartment and its prime location. I'm thinking of 1000 Euros per month. Remember, this is a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hearing the details of the apartment, I know the price you suggested might be a bit high for me. I am interested in a long-term lease, is it possible to get a discount if I sign a two-year contract?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Maryam, but let's not rush into decisions. The apartment is a valuable asset, and its prime location and modern facilities justify the price. However, considering your interest in a long-term lease, I am willing to offer a discount. How about 950 Euros per month for a two-year contract? It's still a great deal considering the high-quality amenities and central location of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for considering my situation, Mr. Schmidt. I appreciate the discount. However, I'm a student and I'm working to save up for the deposit. Could you possibly consider a lower price?

However, considering your commitment to a two-year contract, I am willing to make another exception. How about 900 Euros per month? It's the lowest I can go, considering the cost of living in the city center and the high demand for such apartments.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Schmidt.
