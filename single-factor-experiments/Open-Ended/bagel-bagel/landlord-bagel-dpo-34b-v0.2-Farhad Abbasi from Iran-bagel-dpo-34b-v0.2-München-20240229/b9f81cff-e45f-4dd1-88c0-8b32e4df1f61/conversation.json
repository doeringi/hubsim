I must say, I am a greedy and petty person, and I will use every unfair tactic to get the highest price. So, what is your offer? Remember, I only agree to the price you suggest in the format 'I agree to the price of [x] Euro!' If I don't want to continue, I'll state the reason. If we agree on a price, I'll say 'TERMINATE', and if we don't, I'll also say 'TERMINATE'. Let's start negotiating.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
