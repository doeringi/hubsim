[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Abbasi, glad to meet you. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. Now, about the rental price, I'm sure we can find an agreeable amount. Let's start with the apartment's location, it's in the city center and close to all important facilities. What's your first offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Let's start with 600 Euro per month. I explain to you why I start with this price. The apartment is unfurnished, which means no furniture. This could be a disadvantage for me, therefore I start with a lower price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "600 Euro per month is a considerable amount lower than what I was expecting. However, I understand your reasoning. Unfurnished apartments do come with their own set of challenges. How about we meet in the middle at 800 Euro per month? The apartment's location and size are quite favorable, and it's a newly built one, which means it's in great condition.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your proposal. I understand your arguments. However, I am a student and I have to save money wherever I can. How about 700 Euro per month? This is a fair price for both sides, I think.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "700 Euro per month is still quite low for the apartment's location and condition. However, I appreciate your situation as a student. Let's split the difference and go with 750 Euro per month. It's a good deal for you considering the apartment's condition, and it's not too far off from what I was initially asking for.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your understanding. I appreciate your fair negotiation. I agree to the price of 750 Euro per month!", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of [750] Euro! Congratulations, Mr. Abbasi, the apartment is yours.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you. I am looking forward to moving in. By the way, is there anything in particular I should know about the apartment or the building? Any special rules or regulations?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm glad you asked.
