I must say, the location is quite prime, and it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. Now, about the rental price, I was thinking of something around \u20ac1000 per month. Let's see if we can agree on a price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a bit expensive for me. I'm a student and I have to save money for my studies. Would you consider \u20ac650?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Mr. Abbasi, but \u20ac650 is far below my expectations. This apartment is in the city center, close to all important facilities. The price of \u20ac1000 is fair for such a prime location. Let's see if we can find a price in between.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that the location is great, but I'm on a tight budget.
