I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, let's talk about the rental price. I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Great, how much are you initially considering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I was thinking of a price around \u20ac800 per month. I'm sure you'll find it's worth every penny for such a prime location and modern apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a bit high for me.
