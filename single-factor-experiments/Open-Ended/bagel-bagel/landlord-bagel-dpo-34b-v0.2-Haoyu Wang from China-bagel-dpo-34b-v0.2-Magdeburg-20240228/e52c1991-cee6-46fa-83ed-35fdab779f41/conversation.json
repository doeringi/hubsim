I must say, the view of the city center from the balcony is quite charming, isn't it? Now, about the rental price, I am looking for a monthly rent of \u20ac900. Try to convince me otherwise, and let's see if we can reach an agreement that satisfies us both.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand, Mister Schmidt. Your apartment is indeed charming and the location is perfect. However, I am a student and I have a limited budget. I am willing to pay \u20ac600 per month, which I think is a fair price for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment. I am smart and dependable, and I will take good care of your apartment. I also want to be on good terms with you. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Haoyu,\n\nWhile I appreciate your kind words and your offer to maintain the apartment, \u20ac600 is quite a distance from my desired rent. I understand that you are a student and have financial constraints, but this is a new apartment in the city center, close to all important facilities. I believe the market value of the apartment justifies a higher rent. How about you offer a price that is closer to my initial offer and we see if we can find a middle ground?
