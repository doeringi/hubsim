[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Mister Wang, I'm glad you found the apartment to your liking. Now, let's discuss the rental price. I am sure we can find an amount that suits both our interests.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Of course. Considering the apartment's location in the city center and its size, I think a price of 750 euros per month would be fair. This includes all necessary facilities and a parking space.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I see. 750 euros per month is a considerable amount, and I appreciate your offer. However, I believe the apartment's worth is much higher. Why don't we aim higher, say, 900 euros per month? That seems more fitting for such a prime location and the overall quality of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, but let's consider the current market situation. The demand for apartments is not as high as it used to be, which affects the rental prices. Moreover, the apartment is unfurnished, which means you would need to provide your own furniture. Taking these factors into account, I believe 700 euros per month would be a more reasonable price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Well, Mister Wang, you do have a point. However, I am not in a rush to rent out my apartment. I am willing to wait for a tenant who can appreciate the true value of my property. How about we meet in the middle at 800 euros per month? That sounds like a fair compromise to me.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I believe 750 euros per month is a more reasonable price, considering the unfurnished state of the apartment and the current market situation. I hope we can find a middle ground.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mister Wang, I hear you out. 750 euros per month is not an unacceptable offer, but I am hoping for a bit more for such a prime location. Let's split the difference once more and say 775 euros per month. I believe this is a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point of view, Mister Wang. However, I must insist on 750 euros per month. This price is the best I can offer considering the unfurnished state of the apartment and the current market situation. I hope you understand.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mister Wang, I respect your position, but I cannot accept 750 euros per month for my apartment. It is worth more than that, and I am not willing to settle for anything less than 775 euros per month. If you cannot agree to this price, I am afraid we must terminate the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position, Mister Wang. However, I cannot agree to 775 euros per month. As I mentioned before, 750 euros per month is the best I can offer considering the unfurnished state of the apartment and the current market situation.

If you are unwilling to meet my price of 775 euros per month, I must terminate the negotiation. I wish you the best of luck in your search for an apartment.
