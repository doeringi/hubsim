[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Mr. Wang, I'm glad you're interested in my apartment. I must say, the rental price for this newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center is already quite attractive. It's close to all important facilities, including the supermarket and public transportation. I'm sure you'll find it a great place to live. Let's discuss the price now.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds great. However, I am a student and I am looking for something more affordable. Could you offer me a discount?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand that you're a student, but this apartment is already at a very competitive price. The location and condition of the apartment are top-notch. However, I do want to accommodate students like you. So, how about 1000 euros per month? That's a considerable amount lower than the market price, but given your situation, I'm willing to make an exception.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for understanding my situation. However, as a student, I am on a very tight budget. Could you offer me a better discount?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I appreciate your persistence, but I can't go any lower than 1000 euros per month. This is a generous discount already, and I'm sure you'll find it affordable.

However, I am afraid that I cannot afford that price. Could you offer me a smaller discount?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, but I can't lower the price any further. 1000 euros per month is a significant discount already. However, I can offer you a two-months rent free deal. You'll pay 2000 euros for the first two months, and then 1000 euros per month afterward. This is the best I can offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for you.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " That sounds like a fair deal. I agree to the price of 1000 euros per month after the first two months!", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of [1000] Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}]
