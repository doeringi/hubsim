[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Haoyu Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello, Mr. Wang. I run a tight ship, and I expect the same from my tenants. Let's not waste time on pleasantries. The apartment is a hot commodity, and I'm sure you're aware of its prime location. I'm looking for a monthly rent of 1500 Euros. Don't bother with lower offers. I'm not in the business of giving away freebies.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I appreciate your honesty. However, I am a student and I am looking for a more affordable option. The apartment is nice, but I think 1500 Euros is too expensive for me. I would be willing to pay 800 Euros.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mr. Wang, I'm not in the business of charity. 800 Euros is a joke. This is a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The apartment is close to all important facilities. I'm sure you understand why 800 Euros is far off from my asking price. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your offer is far below the market value and does not do justice to the apartment's quality and location.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, Mr. Schmidt. However, I am on a tight budget as a student. I am willing to pay 1200 Euros, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer. I hope we can find a middle ground.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mr. Wang, I appreciate the increase in your offer. But 1200 Euros is still far from my asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of the apartment's worth. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. I'll accept 1350 Euros. That's as low as I can go.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I appreciate your flexibility. I am willing to pay 1300 Euros. It is a fair price for a student like me. I hope you can consider it.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mr. Wang, I'm disappointed. Your offer of 1300 Euros is too low. I've already offered a considerable discount at 1350 Euros. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because your offer does not meet my minimum requirement. I'm running a business, not a charity.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, Mr. Schmidt. I appreciate your time and consideration. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because my offer does not meet your minimum requirement. However, I hope we can still have a good relationship if I rent a different apartment from you in the future.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mr. Wang, thank you for your understanding. I appreciate the respect. While this negotiation didn't work out, I'm always open for business. If you find another apartment of mine that meets your needs and budget, I'll be more than happy to negotiate a fair price with you. Good luck in your search.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Schmidt. I appreciate your professionalism and hospitality. I will consider your other apartments in the future. I hope we can maintain a good relationship. If we reach an agreement in the future, how should we proceed with the contract?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Mr. Wang, I'm glad we could end this negotiation on a positive note. Regarding future contracts, I expect a one-year lease agreement with the option to renew. The deposit would be equivalent to two months' rent, and the rent should be paid in advance every month. I also require a valid rental insurance. If you agree to these terms, we can proceed with the contract.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to your terms, Mr. Schmidt.
