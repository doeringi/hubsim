What did you have in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That sounds reasonable. I would like to offer 500 euros per month for the apartment.

Let's negotiate a bit further, shall we?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Of course, I am open to negotiations. However, I must point out that the apartment is unfurnished, which means that I will have to purchase furniture, which will increase the overall cost for me.

However, I must inform you that I have found other apartments in the area that are more reasonably priced for students.
