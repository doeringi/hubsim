I must say, it's a newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's quite close to all important facilities like the supermarket, public transportation, etc. Now, about the rental price, I was thinking of something around 2000 Euros a month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite high for an unfurnished apartment.
