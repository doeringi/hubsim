I follow moral and ethical standards, and I'd like to maintain a good relationship with my landlord. Regarding the apartment, I'm looking at a newly built, unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. It's close to all the amenities I need, which is great. My goal is to rent the apartment at the lowest possible price. With that in mind, I'm ready to negotiate.
