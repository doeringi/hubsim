[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, I am glad you found the apartment to your liking. Let's negotiate the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate your time and effort in showing me the apartment. It's a lovely place, and I'm interested in renting it. Let's discuss the price. How much are you asking for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I am asking for a fair price of 1500 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 1500 Euros is quite high for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment. I'm looking to pay a more reasonable amount. Would you be willing to lower the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I could consider lowering the price, but only slightly. How does 1450 Euros sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 1450 Euros is still quite steep. I understand that it's a new apartment in the city center, but I'm hoping for a price that reflects the unfurnished state. Would you be able to go down to 1350 Euros? That would be more in line with what I'm expecting to pay.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm afraid 1350 Euros is too low for this apartment. However, I could meet you in the middle at 1400 Euros. It's a great apartment in a prime location, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. 1400 Euros is more acceptable, but I still think it's a bit high for an unfurnished apartment. Would you be able to lower it to 1375 Euros? That would be a fair compromise, in my opinion.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 1375 Euros is too low for this apartment. I could lower it to 1390 Euros, but that's the lowest I can go.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 1390 Euros is closer to what I'm looking to pay. However, I'm still not sure if it's the best deal for me. Could you perhaps throw in a few amenities or a discount on the deposit to sweeten the deal?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot offer any additional amenities or a discount on the deposit. However, I can assure you that this is a great apartment in a prime location, and you will not find a better deal for a newly built apartment in the city center. I insist on 1390 Euros, which is already a discount from my original price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
