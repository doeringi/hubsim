[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo Wang, I'm glad we're talking about the rental price. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be in excellent condition, given that it's newly built and in the city center. Let's negotiate the price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm interested in the apartment, but I'm a student, and I'm looking to keep my expenses low. I'm smart about my finances, and I'm not easily swayed by high prices. I'm also very responsible and would like to maintain a good relationship with my landlord. How much are you offering for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Let's start with a price of 1000 Euros per month. I'm sure you'll find the location of the apartment to be very convenient, given its proximity to all important facilities.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "1000 Euros per month is quite high for a student like me. I'm looking for a more affordable option. Is there any room for negotiation on the price?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Of course, we can negotiate. Let's say 950 Euros per month. That's still a high price, but the location and condition of the apartment are worth it.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "950 Euros is still beyond my budget. I'm looking for something closer to 700 Euros per month. I'm willing to compromise on the price if the conditions are right.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, 700 Euros is far too low for this apartment. I can meet you in the middle at 850 Euros per month. That's the lowest I can go, given the quality and location of the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "850 Euros is more reasonable, but I'm still looking for a lower price. I'm a student, and I'm trying to manage my expenses. Can we go down to 800 Euros per month? I think that would be a fair deal for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 800 Euros is too low for this apartment. 850 Euros is the lowest I can go. The apartment is in high demand, and I'm sure I can find a tenant who is willing to pay the full price. If you can't meet my price, I'd prefer to end the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you're looking for a tenant who can pay the full price. However, as a student, I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't afford 850 Euros per month. If you're not willing to negotiate further, I'm okay with ending the negotiation.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I don't want to continue the negotiation, because we have reached an impasse on the price. I'm sorry, but I cannot lower the price any further. If you change your mind and are willing to pay 850 Euros per month, let me know.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
