Let's focus on the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mr. Schmidt. I'm looking for a fair price for this beautiful apartment. How much are you thinking for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm looking for the highest possible price for this apartment. I think 1500 Euro per month would be a fair price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite a high price, Mr. Schmidt. I'm sure the apartment is worth it, but I'm on a tight budget.

If you believe the price is not high enough, I can reconsider my offer. How about 1050 Euro per month?
