The lease agreement does require a security deposit of one month's rent, which would be 350 euros. This deposit is refundable at the end of the lease term, provided that there are no damages to the apartment and all rent payments have been made on time.\n\nThere are no penalties or fees for breaking the lease early, but you would need to provide at least one month's notice before the end of the lease term.\n\nI'm glad to hear that you agree to the rental price of 350 euros per month.
