I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. Let's discuss the price. How much were you considering?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate your time and effort. Regarding the price, I'm looking for something very competitive, as I'm a student and I need to manage my expenses carefully. I'm hoping we can find a fair deal that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Yi-Nuo. As a landlord, I'm also looking for a fair deal. Would you be willing to start at \u20ac650 per month? This is a very competitive price for the location and the quality of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your offer, but I must be honest with you.

What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. \u20ac600 is more in line with what I can afford, but it's still a bit higher than my budget.

However, I'm willing to consider a small concession for a student tenant. How about this: if you can pay the rent on time for the first six months, I'll reduce the rent to \u20ac575 per month for the remaining term of the lease. This is a good deal for you, as it's only a short-term commitment on your part. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer is very generous, and I appreciate the consideration for my student status. \u20ac575 per month is much more within my budget, and the short-term commitment makes it more manageable for me.
