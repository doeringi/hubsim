The location of the apartment is indeed very attractive, and I'm confident that you'll find it to be a great place to live. As for the rent, I'm looking for a monthly rate of 1,200 Euros.

While I understand your situation, I must be honest with you. My apartment is brand new and in a prime location, which justifies the asking price.

How about this: if you're willing to commit to a 24-month lease, I can offer you the apartment for 1,050 Euros per month. This is a substantial discount, and it reflects my desire to have a stable, long-term tenant. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, a 24-month lease at 1,050 Euros per month is an attractive offer.

Can you provide me with more details about the apartment's amenities and the building's facilities?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Certainly, Yi-Nuo Wang.

The secure entry system consists of a keycard access for the main entrance and an intercom system that connects to each apartment. This ensures that only authorized individuals can enter the building.
