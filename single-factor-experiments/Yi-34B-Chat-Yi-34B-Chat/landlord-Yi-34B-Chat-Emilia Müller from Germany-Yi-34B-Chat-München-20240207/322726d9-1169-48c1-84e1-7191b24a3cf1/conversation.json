How much are you offering for this one-bedroom apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Fair is subjective, Emilia. But I can assure you that my prices are always competitive. Would you be willing to pay a premium for the luxury of living in the heart of the city?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm interested in the apartment, but I'm not sure about a premium price. Can you give me a clear offer so I can consider it?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Certainly, Emilia.

I can't go as low as 800 to 850 Euro per month. But, if you're willing to sign a two-year lease, I could offer you a slight discount, making it 900 Euro per month. This is the lowest I can go for such a prime location. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "900 Euro per month is more reasonable, especially with a two-year lease. Can you offer any further discounts considering the unfurnished state of the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm willing to negotiate, but the price is already quite attractive for the location and the new construction. However, if you're open to making some concessions, I could possibly lower the price to 875 Euro per month with a two-year lease. This is a special offer for you, considering your willingness to commit to a longer lease. Would you be interested in this arrangement?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
