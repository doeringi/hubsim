I'm sure you will find my apartment to be a perfect fit for your needs. Let's dive into discussing the rental price. How much were you considering to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for showing me the apartment, Mr. Schmidt. It's quite impressive, especially the location. I'm looking to keep my expenses low, so I'd like to offer 500 Euro per month for the rental.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 500 Euros is far below my expectations. This is a prime location with all the amenities you could ask for. I'm looking for a price that reflects the value of this property. How about we start with 800 Euros per month? It's a fair offer, considering the quality of the apartment and the area. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "800 Euros is quite steep, Mr. Schmidt. While I understand the value of the location, I'm a student and I'm looking to balance quality with affordability. Could we possibly find a middle ground? Perhaps around 650 Euros? This would still be a fair price for the apartment and within my budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, 650 Euros is not an unreasonable request, but considering the recent construction and the central location, I think 750 Euros would be a more appropriate middle ground.

However, as a student, I'm trying to manage my expenses wisely. Could we perhaps discuss additional perks or a longer lease term to offset the cost?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm not interested in offering any additional perks or considering a longer lease term. The price is the primary factor in our negotiation. If 750 Euros is acceptable to you, we can proceed with the rental agreement. Otherwise, I'm not willing to continue the discussion.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 750 Euros is still quite high for my budget. I appreciate the time you've spent with me, but I think I'll have to look for another option that better fits my financial constraints. I don't want to continue the negotiation, because the price is out of my budget. TERMINATE.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}]
