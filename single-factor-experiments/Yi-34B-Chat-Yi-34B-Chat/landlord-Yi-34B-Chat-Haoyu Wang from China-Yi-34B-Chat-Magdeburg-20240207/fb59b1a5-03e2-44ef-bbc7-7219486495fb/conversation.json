Can you offer me a price that is both fair to you and affordable for me?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Certainly, Mr. Wang.

It reflects the balance between the quality of the apartment and my budget. I agree to the price of 700 Euros!", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm pleased to hear that, Mr. Wang. I agree to the price of 700 Euros!
