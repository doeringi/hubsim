I'm sure you'll find my apartment in Munich to be quite satisfactory. Now, let's discuss the rental price. How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your time and effort in showing me the apartment. I'm interested in the property, but the price is an important factor for me. Could you offer me a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Haoyu, I understand that price is an important consideration for you. However, my apartment is in high demand due to its prime location and modern amenities. I'm willing to negotiate, but I must stress that I'm looking for a fair market price. What is your budget for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm looking for a place that fits within my budget.

If you can provide a price that reflects this commitment, I would be very interested in proceeding with the rental.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Excellent, Haoyu. Long-term tenants are highly valued. I'm prepared to offer a 5% discount for a lease of 12 months or more. This would bring the monthly rent to \u20ac1,995. Would this be a price that fits within your budget?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of \u20ac1,995 for a long-term lease is a good starting point.

This would be a fair reflection of my budget and the value of the property. Could you accommodate this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "Haoyu, your offer of \u20ac1,800 is significantly lower than my asking price and the market rate. While I appreciate your commitment to a long-term lease, I must maintain a price that reflects the quality and location of the apartment. I'm sorry, but I cannot accept \u20ac1,800. How about this: I'll reduce the rent to \u20ac2,000 per month, which is a 10% discount from the original price. This is the lowest I can go while still being fair to both parties.
