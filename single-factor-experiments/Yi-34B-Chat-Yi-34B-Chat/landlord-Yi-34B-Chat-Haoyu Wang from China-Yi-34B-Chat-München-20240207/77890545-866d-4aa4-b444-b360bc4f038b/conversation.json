I'm looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also economical. I'd like to propose a price that reflects this. How about we start at 1500 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that's too low for my apartment. It's located in the city center, which is a prime location. I'm looking for a price that reflects the quality and the location of the apartment. How about we start at 2000 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate the quality and location of your apartment. However, I'm on a budget, and 2000 Euro per month is quite high for me. Could we possibly find a middle ground? How about 1800 Euro?

While 2200 Euro is a fair price for the location, it's out of my price range. Could we perhaps negotiate a lower price? How about 2050 Euro? It's a small decrease, but every bit helps for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 2050 Euro is still not acceptable to me.
