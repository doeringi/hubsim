I'm looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also convenient, and your apartment seems to fit those criteria. Regarding the rent, I'd like to propose a price that is mutually beneficial.

This would be more in line with my budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I understand your position, but as a landlord, I have my own financial obligations to consider. \u20ac820 per month is not feasible for me.

With a two-year lease, I can consider \u20ac820 per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, a two-year lease is an interesting proposition. It would provide you with the stability of long-term rent, and I could potentially consider a slightly higher rent for that security. How about \u20ac825 per month with a two-year lease? This would be a win-win situation, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Haoyu Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm glad to hear that you're willing to consider a two-year lease. \u20ac825 per month with a two-year lease is acceptable to me.
