I've seen similar apartments in the area, and I'd like to propose a fair price. How about 500 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Max, 500 Euro per month is quite low for an apartment of this quality in the city center. However, considering your student status, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we start at 650 Euro per month? I believe this is a reasonable price for the location and amenities provided. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 650 Euro is still quite high for me as a student.

However, 575 Euro per month is still below my asking price.

This is a fair deal considering the location and the amenities. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 600 Euro per month with included utilities except for electricity is more appealing.

How about this: if you are willing to sign a one-year lease, I can reduce the price to 590 Euro per month, including all utilities except for electricity. This is a good deal for both parties, as it provides you with a stable and affordable living situation, and I have the security of a long-term tenant. What is your decision?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your offer of 590 Euro per month with a one-year lease and included utilities except for electricity is quite attractive.

I agree to the price of 590 Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 590 Euro! Great! We have a deal, Max.
