What's the highest price you're willing to pay for a brand new, centrally located one-bedroom unit?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Hmm, well, considering the location and the fact that it's a new apartment, I'd say the highest price I'd be willing to pay would be around 1,500 Euro per month. Is that something we can work with?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Max, but that's far too low for an apartment of this quality. Let's start with a more realistic offer, shall we? How about 2,000 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "2,000 Euro per month is quite steep, Mister Schmidt. I'm looking for something more in line with the market value. Can we negotiate a bit lower? Perhaps around 1,800 Euro?", "role": "user", "name": "Max M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "1,800 Euro is still not acceptable. This apartment is in the city center, and it's brand new.

How about this: if you're willing to pay 2,000 Euro per month, I'll include a parking spot at no extra charge. It's a valuable amenity in the city center. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "A parking spot is indeed a valuable amenity.
