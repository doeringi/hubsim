I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite comfortable and convenient, especially with its central location. So, let's discuss the rental price. How much do you think is a fair price for this newly built, unfurnished one-bedroom apartment in the city center?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate the offer. The apartment seems to be in a great location, and I'm interested in the potential. I believe a fair price for this apartment would be around 800 Euros per month.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but that price is far too low for such a prime location and a newly built apartment. I'm looking for a price that reflects the value of the property and the amenities it offers. How about we start at 1,200 Euros per month? I believe that's a more reasonable offer.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Mister Schmidt. However, I must consider my budget as a student. While the location and quality of the apartment are certainly attractive, I'm searching for a price that aligns with my financial capabilities.

This would be more in line with what I'm willing to pay.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I have to ensure that the rent reflects the investment I've made in the property. 1,000 Euros per month is still below my expectations.

This would be a fair compromise, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your offer of 1,100 Euros per month is more acceptable. It's closer to my budget and takes into account the quality of the apartment. I think this could be a good deal. Would you agree to 1,100 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm glad to hear that you find the offer more acceptable.
