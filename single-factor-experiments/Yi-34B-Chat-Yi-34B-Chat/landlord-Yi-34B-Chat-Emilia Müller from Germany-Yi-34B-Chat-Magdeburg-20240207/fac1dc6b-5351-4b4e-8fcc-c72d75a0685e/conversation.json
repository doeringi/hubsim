It's a beautiful place, centrally located, and perfect for someone looking for a comfortable living space. How much were you thinking of offering for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Schmidt. I'm looking for a place that is not only comfortable but also fits within my budget. I've seen similar apartments in the area, and I was thinking of starting around 600 Euros per month. Does that sound reasonable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, 600 Euros per month is quite a bit lower than what I was expecting. This is a prime location, and the apartment is brand new. I think 850 Euros per month would be more in line with the value of the property. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, 850 Euros per month is quite high for an unfurnished apartment. I appreciate the quality of the apartment, but considering the current market and the fact that it's unfurnished, I would like to propose 700 Euros per month. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the apartment and the amenities it offers.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, while 700 Euros per month is closer to what I had in mind, I still believe it's on the lower side for the location and the quality of the apartment.

What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. 750 Euros per month is more acceptable, but I would like to discuss a few additional points before we reach an agreement.

However, I understand that you're also looking for a fair deal. If you can come up with a compelling reason why I should accept 700 Euros per month, I might be willing to reconsider. Otherwise, 750 Euros per month is the lowest I'm willing to go.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I understand your position. The apartment is indeed of high quality and in a prime location. However, I'm a student and I'm looking to manage my expenses wisely. I've been looking at similar apartments in the area, and I've found that 700 Euros per month is a fair market rate, given that the apartment is unfurnished. Additionally, I'm a responsible tenant who values a long-term relationship with my landlord. I'm willing to commit to a two-year lease, which might help reduce the monthly rent to a more acceptable level for both of us. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Emilia, your situation as a student and your desire for a fair deal is understandable. A two-year lease could indeed be beneficial to both of us. However, I must maintain my goal of achieving the highest possible rent for my property. Let's compromise on 725 Euros per month, and in exchange, I'll be willing to sign a two-year lease with you. This way, you get a slightly reduced rate, and I get the long-term stability of a fixed tenant. How does that sound?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the offer of a two-year lease at 725 Euros per month.
