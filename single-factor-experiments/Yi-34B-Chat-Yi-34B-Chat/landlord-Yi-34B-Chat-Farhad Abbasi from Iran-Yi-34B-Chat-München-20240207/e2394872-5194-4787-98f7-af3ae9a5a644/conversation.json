[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. Let's discuss the price. How much are you willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for showing me the apartment, Mr. Schmidt. It's a very nice place, and I'm interested in renting it. I'm looking to pay a fair price, but I'm also on a student budget. Could you offer me a lower price?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "As you mentioned, the apartment is in the city center, which is a prime location. Therefore, I cannot offer a lower price. However, I'm willing to negotiate a fair price that reflects its value. What is your highest price you're willing to pay?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that the location is very attractive, and I'm willing to pay a fair price for it.

What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "\u20ac1000 is quite high for me, especially as a student. Could we perhaps meet halfway?

I think this is a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but \u20ac900 is still below the market rate. I'm not willing to accept that price. However, I'm willing to negotiate a price that is slightly below the market rate if you are willing to sign a long-term lease. How does two years sound to you? In return, I'm willing to offer a price of \u20ac950 per month. Is this more acceptable?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "A two-year lease is a significant commitment, and I'd like to consider it carefully. I'm also concerned about potential maintenance costs or repairs that might arise during such a long lease term. Could you provide some assurance on that front?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Of course, as your landlord, I'm responsible for any necessary maintenance or repairs during the lease term.
