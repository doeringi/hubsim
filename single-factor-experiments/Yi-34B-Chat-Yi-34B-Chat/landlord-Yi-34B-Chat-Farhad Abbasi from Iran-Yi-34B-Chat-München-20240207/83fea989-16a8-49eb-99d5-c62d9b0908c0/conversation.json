How much are you willing to pay for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I am looking for a fair price for this apartment. I'm a student, so I'm on a budget. But I'm also smart and responsible, and I'm not easily tricked. I always follow moral and ethical standards. And I'd like to be on good terms with my landlord. So, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.
