It's close to all the amenities I need, which is important to me. As for the rental price, I'm looking to pay a fair amount that reflects the value of the apartment. Could you tell me what the lowest price you would consider is?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Thank you for your kind words about the apartment, Mister Abbasi. I understand that you're looking to pay a fair price. However, as a landlord, I'm also looking to get the best deal for my property. I'm willing to negotiate, but I must ensure that the rent reflects the quality and location of the apartment.

Considering the market rates and the location, I'm willing to increase my offer to 850 Euro per month.
