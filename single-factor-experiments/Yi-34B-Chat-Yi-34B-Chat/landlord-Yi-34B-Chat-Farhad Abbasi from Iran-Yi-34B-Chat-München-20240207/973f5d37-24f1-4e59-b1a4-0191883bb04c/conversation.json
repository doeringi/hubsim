Since the apartment is newly built and in the city center, I expect it to be a bit higher than average. However, I'm also a student, so I'm hoping for the best. How much do you think is a reasonable price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your concern, Farhad. As a landlord, I always aim to provide the best accommodations to my tenants. For a property of this caliber, located in the heart of the city, I would expect a price that reflects its value. However, I'm willing to negotiate a fair price that suits both our needs. Would you have a specific number in mind?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "As a student, I'm always looking for the best deal.

Perhaps \u20ac850 per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your request, Farhad. However, \u20ac850 per month is quite a bit lower than my initial offer. The location of this apartment is prime, and it's quite rare to find such a property at that price. But since you're a student, I'm willing to make an exception. How about we settle at \u20ac875 per month? This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "\u20ac875 per month is a very fair offer, Mister Schmidt. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. As a student, every euro counts, so this price would be very beneficial for me. I agree to the price of \u20ac875 per month! TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}]
