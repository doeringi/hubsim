[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen.

Let's indeed discuss the rental price. How much would you be willing to pay for a comfortable and centrally located place like this?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate the quality of the apartment and its location. However, as a student, I need to be mindful of my expenses. Could you offer me a price that reflects my budget as a student?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your situation, Mister Abbasi. As a landlord, I am willing to negotiate a fair price that takes into account your budget as a student. What price range were you considering?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I would appreciate it if you could start with a lower offer, considering the unfurnished state of the apartment. This would help me better align my budget with the cost of living in Munich.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Certainly, Mister Abbasi.

Does this price fit within your budget?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm grateful for your initial offer. While it's a good starting point, I must confess it's slightly above my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate a lower price, say around \u20ac750 per month, to accommodate my student expenses?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I understand your need for a lower price, Mister Abbasi. However, \u20ac750 is quite low for an apartment of this quality and location. How about we find a middle ground at \u20ac775 per month? This should be more acceptable for both of us. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, your proposal of \u20ac775 is more reasonable. It's closer to my budget, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I believe this price reflects the balance between the quality of the apartment and my financial constraints as a student. I agree to the price of \u20ac775 Euro!", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm glad to hear that, Mister Abbasi. Your agreement to \u20ac775 per month is acceptable to me. Let's proceed with the rental agreement at this price. TERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
