I understand that you are interested in renting my apartment in the city center of M\u00fcnchen. Let's discuss the price. How much are you willing to pay for this wonderful, newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your offer, Mister Heine. I am looking for a fair price that reflects the value of the apartment and the location. Based on my research, I believe that a price around \u20ac1,200 per month would be reasonable. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I cannot accept that price. It is far below the market value for an apartment of this size and location.

However, since you seem like a serious tenant and I want to ensure the apartment is occupied, I am willing to make a special offer. I will accept \u20ac1,400 per month. This is my final offer.
