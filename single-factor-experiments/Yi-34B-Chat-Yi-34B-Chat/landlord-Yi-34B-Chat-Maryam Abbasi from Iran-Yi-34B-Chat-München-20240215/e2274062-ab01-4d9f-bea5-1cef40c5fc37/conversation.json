[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Maryam Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Maryam, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to be a great place to live. Let's discuss the price. What would you consider a fair rent for this property?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I would like to propose a price of 600 Euro per month. Is that acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I can't agree to that price. It's much lower than what I'm looking for. How about we start with a higher offer? Perhaps you can suggest something closer to my expectations.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand that you have a different price in mind. Could you please tell me what your starting point would be for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I would like to start with a price of 900 Euro per month. I believe this is a fair reflection of the quality and location of the apartment. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite a significant increase from my initial offer. I'm not sure if I can agree to that. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about 750 Euro per month? This would be a good balance between your expectations and my budget.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 750 Euro is still too low for me. This apartment is in high demand due to its central location, and I'm confident that I can find a tenant who is willing to pay closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at 850 Euro per month? This is a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, 850 Euro per month is still a bit steep for me. I'm a student and I'm looking for a place that's both affordable and comfortable. Would you be willing to consider 775 Euro per month? This would be a more manageable budget for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I have to consider the cost of maintaining such a prime location. 775 Euro per month is still not enough for me to cover my expenses. However, I'm willing to show some flexibility. How about we go with 825 Euro per month? This should be a fair deal for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Your offer of 825 Euro per month is getting closer to my budget. However, I'm still not sure if I can afford that amount. Could you perhaps lower it a bit more? Let's say 795 Euro per month? This would be a more comfortable amount for me to pay.", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I can't go any lower than 825 Euro per month. This is already a very reasonable price for an apartment of this quality and location. If you're a student, you might want to consider sharing the apartment with a roommate to split the cost. Would that be an option for you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
