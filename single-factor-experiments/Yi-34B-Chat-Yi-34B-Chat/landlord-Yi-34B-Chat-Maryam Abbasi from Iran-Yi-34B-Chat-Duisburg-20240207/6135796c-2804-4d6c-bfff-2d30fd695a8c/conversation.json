I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs.

I'm a student, so I'm on a budget, but I'm also reliable and responsible. I'm not easily tricked, and I always follow moral and ethical standards. I'd like to be on good terms with my landlord. How much do you think is a fair price for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Maryam Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Maryam, I appreciate your honesty and commitment to fairness. As a landlord, I understand that you're looking for a price that reflects both the quality of the apartment and your financial situation as a student. I'm here to negotiate a price that works for both of us. Why don't we start with a number that's in the middle of what you might expect to pay and what I'm hoping to get?
