So, what is your budget for the rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. How much are you offering for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the quality and location of the apartment. I would say a price around 1,500 Euro per month would be reasonable. What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's a bit high for my budget. I was hoping for something closer to 1,200 Euro per month. Is there any wiggle room on your part?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "1,200 Euro per month is quite a bit lower than my initial offer.

Could we discuss the deposit and any additional fees?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Certainly, but let's focus on the rental price for now. Once we agree on the price, we can discuss other terms and conditions. How does 1,350 Euro per month sound to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "It sounds good to me. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Would you be willing to go a bit lower, say 1,300 Euro per month? That would make it more comfortable for me.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "1,300 Euro per month is getting closer to my limit. I could agree to that, but I would need to discuss some other terms with you, such as the possibility of a shorter notice period in case you decide to move out early. Would you be open to discussing that?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
