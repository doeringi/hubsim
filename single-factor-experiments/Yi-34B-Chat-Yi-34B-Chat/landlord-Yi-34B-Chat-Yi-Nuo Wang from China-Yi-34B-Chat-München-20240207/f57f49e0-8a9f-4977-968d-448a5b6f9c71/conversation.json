I'm prepared to pay a fair price for the convenience and location. How much are you asking for the rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Yi-Nuo Wang, I understand that you're looking for a balance between quality and cost. The apartment's location is indeed prime, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm looking to rent it out for a competitive price, reflecting its desirability. What's your highest offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm willing to pay a competitive price, but I want to make sure it's a price that reflects the value of the apartment as well as my budget as a student.
