I understand that you're interested in my newly built unfurnished 50 square meter one-bedroom apartment in the city center. The location is indeed very convenient, with easy access to supermarkets, public transportation, and other essential amenities.\n\nLet's get straight to the point. I'm looking to rent out my apartment for the highest price possible, reflecting its prime location and modern construction. I'm sure you're aware that real estate in the city center is highly sought after, and I'm confident that my apartment offers exceptional value.\n\nI'm willing to negotiate with you, but I must stress that I am not interested in lowball offers. My goal is to find a tenant who appreciates the quality and convenience of this property and is willing to pay a fair market price.\n\nWould you be willing to start the bidding at \u20ac1,500 per month? I believe this is a reasonable starting point, given the apartment's attributes.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I'm not interested in paying \u20ac1,500 per month.

However, I'm not in the business of offering bargain prices. My apartment is in high demand, and I'm confident that someone will be willing to pay a premium for it.\n\nIf you're serious about renting the apartment, I would suggest you reconsider your budget. Perhaps there's some flexibility on your part. The location and quality of this property are hard to beat, and I'm sure you'll find it an excellent investment for your living situation.\n\nAre you prepared to make a higher offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not prepared to make a higher offer at this time.

If you're not willing to consider a lower offer, then I'm not sure there's much point in continuing this negotiation either.\n\nI'm looking for an apartment that fits within my budget, and while your apartment may be desirable, I need to find a price that works for me. If you're not open to negotiating the price downward, then we may not be able to reach an agreement.\n\nI don't want to continue the negotiation, because you're not willing to consider a lower offer at this time.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry to hear that, Yi-Nuo Wang. It seems we've reached an impasse.
