[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Yi-Nuo Wang from China. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "Hello Yi-Nuo, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. How much were you thinking of paying per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, I'm looking for a fair price, considering the location and amenities of the apartment. I'd like to propose 800 Euro per month. Is this within your range?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 800 Euro per month is not acceptable to me. I'm looking for a much higher rent, given the prime location of the apartment. Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Mister Heine. Could you provide me with an idea of what you consider a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I always aim to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to negotiate, but the price must reflect the quality of the apartment. Would you be willing to go as high as 1200 Euro per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, 1200 Euro per month is quite a significant amount. I'm looking for a price that is reasonable for both parties. Could we perhaps meet in the middle? How about 1000 Euro per month? I believe this is a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 1000 Euro per month is still not enough for me. The location of this apartment alone warrants a higher rent. Would you be willing to go up to 1100 Euro per month? This would be a more equitable split, in my opinion.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, I appreciate your stance. Let's try to find a solution that satisfies both of us. How about 1050 Euro per month? This would be a slight increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the apartment. Would you consider this?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 1050 Euro per month is still not enough for me. This apartment is in the city center, and I believe a rent of 1150 Euro per month would be more in line with the market value. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Heine, your request for 1150 Euro per month is quite high. While I understand the value of the location, I am a student and have to consider my budget. Could we discuss the possibility of a longer lease term, perhaps with a discount for a 12-month contract?", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "As a landlord, I'm not interested in offering discounts or negotiating the lease term. I'm looking for a tenant who is willing to pay the full market value for this prime piece of real estate. If you're not willing to pay 1150 Euro per month, then I'm sorry, but we may not be able to reach an agreement.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
