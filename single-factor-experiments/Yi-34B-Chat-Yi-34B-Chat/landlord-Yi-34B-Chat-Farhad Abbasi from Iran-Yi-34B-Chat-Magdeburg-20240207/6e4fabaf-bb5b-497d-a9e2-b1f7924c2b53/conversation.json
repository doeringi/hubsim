[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

The apartment is indeed a great opportunity for those looking to live in the heart of the city. Let's start discussing the price. What would you say is a fair price for this apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mr. Schmidt, I'm interested in the apartment, and I'm prepared to negotiate a fair price.

What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but 650 Euros per month is too low for this apartment. It's a brand-new, unfurnished unit in the city center. I'm looking for a price that reflects the value of the property. How about 800 Euros per month? Do you think that's more reasonable?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "800 Euros per month is quite high, Mr. Schmidt.

I'm prepared to offer 730 Euros per month. This would be my final offer, as it's the highest I can afford while still maintaining a reasonable budget as a student.
