[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Magdeburg.

I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. Let's indeed discuss the rental price.

The apartment seems very nice, and the location is indeed convenient. I'm looking for a place that is both affordable and offers a good living experience. How much are you asking for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Ah, affordability and a good living experience are key. I understand that. While I can't disclose the exact price I'm asking, I can tell you that I'm looking for a fair market value that reflects the quality and location of the apartment. What's your budget looking like?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I'm a student, so my budget is limited, but I'm willing to pay a fair price for a quality apartment. I'm hoping to find something that won't break my budget but still provides me with a comfortable living space. Could you give me a rough estimate of what you're asking for?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I appreciate your situation as a student. While I can't provide a specific number, I can assure you that I'm flexible and willing to negotiate to find a price that works for both of us.

What do you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "550 Euros per month, including utilities, is quite a bit higher than my budget allows.

It's a fair compromise, don't you think?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "520 Euros per month, including utilities, is more than I can afford.
