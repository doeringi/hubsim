I'm really looking for something closer to 750 Euro per month. I'm sorry if this isn't what you're expecting, but I'm trying to be realistic with my financial situation. Would you consider meeting in the middle at 775 Euro? That would be a fair compromise, I believe.", "role": "user", "name": "Yi-Nuo Wang from China"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, Yi-Nuo, but I cannot accept 775 Euro per month. This apartment is in high demand due to its location and quality, and I'm confident that I can find a tenant who is willing to pay the full 1000 Euro. I'm sorry if this is out of your budget, but I must insist on the market value for this property.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I respect your position, Mister Schmidt. If the apartment is in such high demand, I understand that you may have other options. I'm sorry, but I cannot afford to pay 1000 Euro per month.
