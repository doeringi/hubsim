[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in Duisburg. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Farhad, it's my pleasure to have you over. I'm sure you'll find the apartment to your liking. So, what price were you thinking for the rental?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I'm interested in finding a fair price for both parties. How do you feel about starting with \u20ac800 per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but I'm looking for a price that reflects the high quality of this apartment. \u20ac800 seems a bit low for the location and the amenities it offers. Would you be willing to reconsider your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, Mister Schmidt. How about \u20ac900 then? I believe this is a reasonable price for the apartment's location and amenities.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Farhad, while \u20ac900 is closer to what I'm seeking, I still believe the apartment is worth more. It's a brand new construction in the city center, close to all amenities. Would you be willing to go a bit higher?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I appreciate the value of the apartment. However, as a student, I have a limited budget. How about we meet in the middle at \u20ac950? I think this is a fair price for both parties.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "I'm sorry, but \u20ac950 is still not the price I'm looking for. This apartment is in high demand due to its central location and modern features. I need a price that reflects its true value. Would you be willing to go up to \u20ac1000?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I understand your position. However, \u20ac1000 is quite high for me, considering my student status. I'm looking for a deal that allows me to live comfortably without overspending. How about we settle at \u20ac975? I believe this is a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Farhad, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal. However, \u20ac975 is still not the price I'm seeking for this apartment. It's a premium property in a prime location. I'm looking for a tenant who values the quality and convenience it offers, and who is willing to pay accordingly. I'm sorry, but I cannot accept \u20ac975. Perhaps we should reconsider if this is the right fit for you.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your perspective, Mister Schmidt. If you believe the apartment is worth more than \u20ac975, I'm willing to hear your counter-offer. What price would you consider fair for the apartment?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Farhad, I'm glad to hear that you're open to discussing a fair price. I believe that \u20ac1050 per month would be a fair reflection of the apartment's value. This price takes into account the high standard of living and the prime location.
