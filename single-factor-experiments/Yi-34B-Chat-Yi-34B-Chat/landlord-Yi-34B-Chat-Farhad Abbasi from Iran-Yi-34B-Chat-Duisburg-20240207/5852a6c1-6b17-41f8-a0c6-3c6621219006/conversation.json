Would you be willing to increase your offer?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your point, Mister Schmidt. As a student, I'm on a budget, but I'm also smart and responsible. I'm willing to negotiate. How about 700 Euros? This is a good balance between what I can afford and what the apartment is worth.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "700 Euros is still below my expectations.

If 700 Euros is your final offer, I'm sorry, but I cannot accept it. I'm looking for a tenant who is willing to pay a fair market price for this apartment.
