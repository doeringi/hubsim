I appreciate your willingness to be reasonable and dependable. However, I am sorry to say that I am unable to accept your proposed rental price of 500 Euros per month. I believe that this price is too low and does not reflect the value of the apartment.\n\nI would like to suggest a rental price of 600 Euros per month. This price takes into account the size and location of the apartment, as well as the current market rates in the area. I believe that this price is fair and reasonable for both parties.\n\nIf you are willing to accept this rental price, I would be happy to move forward with the negotiation. However, if you are unable to accept this price, I will need to consider other potential tenants. Thank you for your understanding.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
