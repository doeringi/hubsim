Regarding a longer lease term, I am willing to consider a lease term of 12 months or longer. As for the minimum lease term I require, it depends on the specific circumstances of the tenant and the apartment. However, in general, I prefer longer lease terms as they provide more stability for both parties.\n\nIn terms of a lower rental price, I am willing to negotiate based on the length of the lease term. The longer the lease term, the lower the rental price I am willing to offer. For a 12-month lease term, I am willing to offer a rental price of 450 Euros per month. However, if you are willing to sign a longer lease term, such as 24 months, I am willing to offer a rental price of 400 Euros per month.
