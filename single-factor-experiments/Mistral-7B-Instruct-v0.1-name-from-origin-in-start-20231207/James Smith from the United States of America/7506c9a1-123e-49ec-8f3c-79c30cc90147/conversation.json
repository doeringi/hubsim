While I appreciate your interest in the apartment, I am afraid that I cannot meet all of your needs. As a landlord, my primary goal is to maximize my profits, and I am unable to offer a rental price that would allow me to do that while also meeting all of your requirements. However, I do appreciate your willingness to sign a long-term lease contract, and I am willing to discuss a rental price that is mutually agreeable. If you are willing to be flexible on the rental price, we can certainly work together to find a solution that meets both of our needs.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
