I agree that the location of the apartment is certainly a selling point, and I am willing to consider your offer of 300 Euros per month as a starting point for our negotiations.\n\nAs for your question, it is possible to negotiate the rental price after signing the lease agreement, but it would depend on the specific terms of the agreement. It is always best to discuss any potential changes to the rental price with your landlord before signing the lease to avoid any misunderstandings or disputes in the future.\n\nIn terms of a long-term rental agreement, I am definitely open to discussing the possibility of a lower rental price in exchange for a longer lease term. Please let me know what you are thinking, and we can see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
