Let's start with a high price, shall we? 500 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "That's quite expensive for an unfurnished one-bedroom apartment. I'm a student and I'm looking for something more affordable. How about 300 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "That is a significant difference, Ms. M\u00fcller. I insist on my initial offer. 500 euros per month is not unreasonable for an apartment of its location and condition.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your point, but 500 euros is really not in my budget. Considering the apartment is unfurnished, I would have to buy furniture as well. How about 350 euros per month? It's a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "I am not convinced, Ms. M\u00fcller. 350 euros is still far from my target price.

It's a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": " I understand your point, Ms. M\u00fcller. However, 400 euros is too low for me. Let's meet somewhere in the middle, shall we? 412 euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "  412 euros is still a bit high for me.

It's a fair compromise.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "While I appreciate your consistency, Ms. M\u00fcller, 400 euros is simply too low for me.
