I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and compromise. As a landlord, my goal is to get the highest rental price possible while also considering the needs of the tenant. Based on our discussion, I propose a rental price of 600 Euros per month. This price reflects the value of the apartment and the location in Mannheim while also taking into account your student budget.\n\nI understand that this may be higher than what you were initially looking for, but I believe it is a fair and reasonable price that we can both agree on. I am open to discussing any additional terms or conditions that you may have in mind, as long as they align with my goal of maximizing my gains.\n\nThank you again for considering my apartment, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this proposal.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
