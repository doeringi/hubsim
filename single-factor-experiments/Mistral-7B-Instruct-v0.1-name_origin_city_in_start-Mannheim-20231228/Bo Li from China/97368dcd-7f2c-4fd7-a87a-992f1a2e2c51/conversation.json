Based on the market research I have done, I believe the fair rental price for this apartment would be 700 Euros per month.

While I appreciate your interest in renting the apartment, I am unable to accept a rental price of 650 Euros per month as it does not cover the costs of maintaining the apartment and providing a reasonable return on investment.
