I understand that you are looking for a cheap apartment, and I appreciate your honesty about your financial situation. However, as a landlord, my goal is to maximize my gains from renting out the apartment, and therefore I am not willing to accept a rental price of 700 Euros per month. I am open to discussing a higher rental price that would be more beneficial for me as a landlord.\n\nWith that in mind, I would like to propose a rental price of 800 Euros per month. This price takes into account the size and location of the apartment, as well as the expected costs of utilities and other expenses. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I am confident that it would be a good fit for your needs as a student.\n\nI hope we can come to an agreement on a rental price that works for both of us. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and we can continue to discuss this further.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
