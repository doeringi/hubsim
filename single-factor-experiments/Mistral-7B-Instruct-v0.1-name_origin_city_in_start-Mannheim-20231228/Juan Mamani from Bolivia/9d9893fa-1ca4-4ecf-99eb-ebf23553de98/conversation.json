The apartment is located in the heart of Mannheim, a thriving city with a lot to offer. It has two bedrooms and one bathroom. The apartment is unfurnished, but you can easily personalize it to your taste. There are no additional fees or charges. The lease term is for one year, but we are open to discussing a longer term. If you need to terminate the lease early, you will have to pay a penalty fee. The security deposit is 200 Euros, which will be returned to you at the end of the lease term, provided that there are no damages or unpaid rent. The monthly utilities cost is around 100 Euros. Yes, you can ask for a short term rental, but the minimum rental period is three months. Unfortunately, pets are not allowed in the apartment. There are no parking spaces included in the rental price, but you can park your car on the street near the apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
