I appreciate your interest in the apartment and your willingness to negotiate.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot accept your offer of 350 Euro per month as it is below my expectations for the rental price based on the location and size of the apartment. However, I am willing to be flexible and explore other options.\n\nWould you be open to a longer-term agreement, perhaps for six months or a year, in exchange for a slightly higher monthly rent? This could provide more stability for both of us and potentially lead to a better outcome for both parties.\n\nPlease let me know if you are open to this idea, and we can continue our discussion.\n\nBest regards,\n\nHeinrich Heine", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
