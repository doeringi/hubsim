While I understand your desire to keep your expenses low, I am afraid that 1,350 Euros per month is not a feasible rental price for this apartment. My goal as a landlord is to maximize my gains, and I believe that the market rate for a 25-square-meter apartment in Mannheim is higher than what you are offering. However, I would be open to discussing a compromise that is mutually beneficial. How about we agree on a rental price of 1,400 Euros per month? This would still be lower than the market rate, but would also provide me with a reasonable return on investment.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
