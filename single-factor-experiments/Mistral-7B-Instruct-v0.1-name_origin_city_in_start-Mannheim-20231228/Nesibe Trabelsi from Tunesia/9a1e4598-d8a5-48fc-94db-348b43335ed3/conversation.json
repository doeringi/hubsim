While I understand your desire to negotiate the rental price, I must emphasize that my primary goal as a landlord is to maximize my gains. Therefore, I am not willing to lower the rental price any further. However, I am open to discussing additional incentives that may be of value to you.\n\nRegarding fees or charges, I must inform you that there will be a one-time security deposit of 200 Euros, which will be refundable at the end of the lease term, provided that the apartment is left in good condition. Additionally, there will be a monthly maintenance fee of 50 Euros, which covers general upkeep of the building and common areas.\n\nAs for the availability of the apartment, I can confirm that it is currently vacant and available for immediate occupancy.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you. If we can come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial, I would be happy to move forward with the rental process.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
