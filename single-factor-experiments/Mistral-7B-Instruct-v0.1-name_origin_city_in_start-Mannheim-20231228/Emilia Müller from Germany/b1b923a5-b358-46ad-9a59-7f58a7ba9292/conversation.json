Let's start by discussing your budget.

How much do you want for the apartment?\nUser 1: Thank you for your interest, Emilia. I would like to propose a rental price of \u20ac500 per month. This includes all utilities and maintenance costs.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Interesting, thank you for your offer. Is there any room for negotiation on the rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I can't afford more than \u20ac450 per month. Is that possible?\nUser 1: I understand your budget, but I'm afraid \u20ac450 per month is not feasible for me to consider. The utilities and maintenance costs alone would exceed \u20ac450, and I need to make sure the apartment is properly maintained and available for tenants. However, I would be willing to discuss a lower rental price if you can provide a higher security deposit to cover potential damages or unpaid rent.", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your response. I would like to propose a rental price of \u20ac420 per month, and I can provide a security deposit of \u20ac1,800. I believe this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
