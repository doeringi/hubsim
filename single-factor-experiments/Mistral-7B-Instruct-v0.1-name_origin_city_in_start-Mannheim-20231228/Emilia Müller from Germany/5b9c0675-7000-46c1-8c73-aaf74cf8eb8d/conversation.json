Based on your previous experience with similar properties in the area, I propose a rental price of 800 euros per month.

What do you think about this price?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I think it's reasonable, but can I negotiate it down?", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Of course, you are welcome to negotiate the rental price. However, please keep in mind that I am a landlord and my primary goal is to maximize my gains. I am willing to discuss a lower rental price, but it would have to be accompanied by a longer lease term or additional responsibilities on the part of the tenant. Is there anything else you would like to discuss in regards to the rental price?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I would like to know if there is any flexibility in the rental price. Can I ask for a lower rental price if I sign a longer lease term?\n\nAlso, what is the current market rate for a 25 square meter apartment in Mannheim?\n\nFinally, what is the minimum lease term you require?\n\nThanks for your time and consideration.\n\nBest regards,\nEmilia", "role": "user", "name": "Emilia M\u00fcller from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you for your questions, Emilia.\n\nYes, you can certainly ask for a lower rental price if you are willing to sign a longer lease term. I am open to discussing different lease terms and rental prices, but please keep in mind that the longer the lease term, the less flexibility I may have in terms of rental price.\n\nAs for the current market rate for a 25 square meter apartment in Mannheim, it can vary depending on the location and the amenities included. However, a reasonable range for a 25 square meter apartment in Mannheim would be between 700 and 800 euros per month.\n\nIn terms of the minimum lease term I require, it depends on the specific circumstances of the tenant and the property. However, I generally prefer longer lease terms, as they provide more stability for both myself and the tenant. If you are interested in a shorter lease term, please let me know and we can discuss the specifics.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, and I look forward to hearing back from you.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
