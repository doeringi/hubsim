The apartment is a great option and I believe it will suit your needs well. However, I would like to clarify a few things before we proceed with the rental agreement.

Additionally, do you have any specific requirements or preferences for the apartment that you would like to discuss?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I prefer 1 year rental. And I would like to include utilities in the rental price. I am a student and I don't have a stable income, so I want to make sure that my expenses are as low as possible. I also want to have a good relationship with my landlord, so I am willing to negotiate for a good price.", "role": "user", "name": "Ryanah Rahman from Saudi-Arabia"}, {"content": "I understand your concerns, Ryanah. A one-year rental agreement with utilities included is certainly possible, and I am willing to work with you to find a fair and reasonable rental price that suits both of our needs.\n\nBased on the size and location of the apartment, I would like to propose a rental price of 700 Euros per month. This includes all utilities and other expenses related to the apartment, such as maintenance and repairs. I believe this price is fair and competitive in the Mannheim area, and it will allow you to have a comfortable living space while keeping your expenses low.\n\nOf course, I am open to discussing this price further and negotiating if necessary. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and we can work together to find a rental agreement that works for both of us.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 700 Euros per month.
