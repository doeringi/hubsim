[{"content": "Hello Mister Schmidt, my name is Farhad Abbasi from Iran. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in M\u00fcnchen. Let's talk about the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "Hello Farhad Abbasi, let's start the negotiation. How much are you willing to pay for the apartment? Remember, I am looking for the highest price possible.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I am interested in the apartment, but as a student, I am on a budget. Considering the apartment is unfurnished and in the city center, I think 500 Euros per month would be a reasonable price.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "That price is too low for me, Farhad Abbasi. I am looking for a higher price. Remember, the apartment is in high demand due to its prime location. Let's negotiate further.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Understandable, given the location. How about 550 Euros per month? It's a reasonable price for an unfurnished apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "That's still too low, Farhad Abbasi. I am looking for a price that reflects the true value of the apartment. Let's negotiate further.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Alright, how about 600 Euros per month? It's a fair price for an unfurnished apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "That's closer to my expectations, Farhad Abbasi. But I believe the apartment's value justifies a higher price. Let's negotiate further.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "I understand your position. Since the apartment is unfurnished and the rent already includes all utility costs, how about 650 Euros per month?", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "That's not acceptable, Farhad Abbasi. I do not want to continue the negotiation, because you are mistaken about the utilities being included in the rent. I only want to discuss the rental price.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": " Apologies for the confusion. Let's stick to the rental price. How about 700 Euros per month, it's a reasonable price for an unfurnished apartment in the city center.", "role": "user", "name": "Farhad Abbasi from Iran"}, {"content": "That's a better offer, Farhad Abbasi. However, I believe the apartment's value justifies a higher price. Let's negotiate further.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}]
