Thank you for showing interest in my apartment. I understand that you're looking for a place to stay and I'm here to help you find the perfect fit for your needs.\n\nAs a landlord, my goal is to maximize my gains by renting out the apartment for the highest price possible. With that in mind, I'm willing to negotiate with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\nThe apartment is 25 square meters and is well-located in the heart of the city. It's a great place to live and offers easy access to all the amenities that New York has to offer.\n\nI'm open to discussing different rental prices with you, but I want to make sure that we both agree on a price that works for both of us.
