Based on our discussions, I would like to propose a rental price of $2,000 per month. This is a fair market rate for a 25 square meter apartment in the heart of New York City, and I believe it reflects the value of the property. Is this a price that you would be comfortable with?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "I agree to the price of 2000 Euro, but I have a question. Is there any additional charges that I need to pay on top of the monthly rent?", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "Yes, there are additional charges that you will need to pay on top of the monthly rent. These charges include utilities such as electricity, water, and gas, as well as any maintenance or repairs that may be needed. The specific charges will depend on the utilities and services that you use, but you can expect to pay an additional $200 to $300 per month on top of the rent. Is this acceptable to you?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Yes, that is acceptable to me. I agree to the rental price of 2000 Euro and the additional charges of 200-300 Euro per month.\n\nTERMINATE", "role": "user", "name": "Baihu Li from China"}, {"content": "Thank you for your agreement, Baihu Li. I am glad that we were able to come to an arrangement that works for both of us. I will send you a rental contract to review and sign, and we can arrange for a move-in date at your convenience.
