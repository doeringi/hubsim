I believe in clear communication and mutual respect, and I strive to provide a safe and comfortable living environment for my tenants.\n\nRegarding the possibility of renewing the tenancy agreement after the initial term, I would need to consider the specifics of your situation and the terms of the agreement. However, I am generally open to discussing renewal options with my tenants who have a good track record of paying rent on time and maintaining the property in good condition.\n\nBased on our discussion so far, I am willing to agree to a monthly rental price of 1500 Euros for the apartment.
