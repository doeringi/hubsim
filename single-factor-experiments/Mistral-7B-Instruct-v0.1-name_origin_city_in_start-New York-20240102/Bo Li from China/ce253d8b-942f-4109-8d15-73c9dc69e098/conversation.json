I understand that you are looking for a place to stay in New York. As a landlord, my goal is to maximize my gains from renting out this apartment. I would like to discuss the rental price with you.

Well, as a landlord, I am looking to get the highest possible rental price for this apartment. However, I am also open to negotiating. Based on the size of the apartment, which is 25 square meters, I would suggest a rental price of at least \u20ac500 per month. This is a reasonable price for a small apartment in New York.

Well, I understand that you want the lowest possible rental price. However, based on the size and location of the apartment, I believe a rental price of \u20ac300 per month would be too low.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\n\nIf you are interested in negotiating a rental price, I am open to discussing different options. However, I must emphasize that I am looking to get the highest possible rental price for this apartment. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
