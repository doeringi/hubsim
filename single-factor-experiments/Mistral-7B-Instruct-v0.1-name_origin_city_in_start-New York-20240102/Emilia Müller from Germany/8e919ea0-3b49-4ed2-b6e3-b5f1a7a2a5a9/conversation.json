I understand that your budget is 1000 Euros per month, and I would be willing to consider negotiating a rental price that falls within that range. However, I must emphasize that my current rental price of 1200 Euros per month is based on the market value of the apartment and the expenses associated with maintaining it. I am not willing to lower the rental price significantly below this amount.\n\nRegarding your question about my previous rental history, I can assure you that I have a solid track record of responsible tenants. I have carefully screened all potential tenants and have only rented to those who meet my criteria for reliability and respect for the property.\n\nAs for the location of the apartment, it is located in a prime area of the city, with easy access to public transportation, shopping, and entertainment. The building is well-maintained and offers a range of amenities, including a doorman, elevator, and laundry facilities.\n\nFinally, I would like to inform you that there are no additional fees or charges associated with renting the apartment. The monthly rent of 1200 Euros covers all expenses, including utilities, maintenance, and any other costs associated with the property.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to ask. Thank you for your interest in renting my apartment.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
