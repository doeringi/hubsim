[{"content": "Hello Mister Heine, my name is Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia. Thanks for inviting me to see the apartment in New York.

I'm sure it will be a great fit for you. To be honest, I'm looking for a tenant who can offer the highest rental price possible. I'm open to discussing the details of the rental agreement, but ultimately, the price will depend on several factors, including the length of the lease and any additional fees or charges that may apply. What is your budget for the monthly rental?", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "My budget is 1000 Euros. I am a student, so I have no credit history. I also want to be on good terms with my landlord. I am dependable and responsible. I will pay the rent on time every month.\n\nIf you agree to the rental price of 1200 Euros, I agree to the price of 1200 Euros. If not, TERMINATE.\n\nI am interested in the apartment, but I need to see the apartment first. Can you schedule a time for me to view it?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Thank you for your interest in the apartment, Nesibe. I appreciate your offer of 1200 Euros per month as the rental price. However, I'm afraid I cannot agree to that price at this time. My primary goal as a landlord is to maximize my gains, and I believe I can achieve a higher rental price with someone who has a credit history and can provide references.\n\nThat being said, I understand that you are a student and may not have a credit history. In that case, I would recommend that you consider obtaining a co-signer or providing additional financial documentation to demonstrate your ability to make timely payments.\n\nAs for scheduling a time for you to view the apartment, I'm sorry, but I am currently unavailable. Please feel free to reach out to me at a later time to discuss further.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}, {"content": "Thank you for the information. I understand your concern about my credit history and lack of references. However, I am confident that I will be able to make the payments on time and maintain good relations with you. I am willing to provide additional financial documentation to demonstrate my ability to pay the rent.\n\nI would like to schedule a time to view the apartment next week. Is that possible?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "Thank you for your understanding, Nesibe. I appreciate your willingness to provide additional financial documentation and your commitment to making timely payments. While I still cannot agree to the rental price of 1200 Euros per month, I am willing to discuss the possibility of a lower rental price or a longer lease term.\n\nRegarding scheduling a time to view the apartment, next week is certainly possible. Please let me know your availability, and we can arrange a suitable time for you to see the property.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
