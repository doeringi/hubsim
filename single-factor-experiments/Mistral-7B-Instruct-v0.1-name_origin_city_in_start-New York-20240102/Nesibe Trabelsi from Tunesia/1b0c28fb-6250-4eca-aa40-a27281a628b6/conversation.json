The amount of the security deposit will be discussed during the negotiation process.\n\nYes, I can provide you with a copy of the lease agreement before signing it. The lease agreement will outline the terms and conditions of the rental agreement, including the rental price, the rental period, the security deposit, and any other relevant details.\n\nThe process for renewing the lease will also be outlined in the lease agreement.
