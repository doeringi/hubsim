How about 1350 Euros per month?\n\nI would also like to know if I can negotiate on other things, like utilities, if I rent this apartment.\n\nI also want to know if I can have a pet in the apartment.\n\nI would like to know if the apartment is fully furnished or if I need to buy my own furniture.\n\nLastly, can I use the apartment as a home office?", "role": "user", "name": "Nesibe Trabelsi from Tunesia"}, {"content": "I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I understand that you are looking for a higher rental price. However, I am afraid that 1350 Euros per month is still not within my budget. I am looking for a rental price of 1500 Euros per month.\n\nRegarding utilities, I can discuss that with you during the signing of the lease agreement.\n\nAs for having a pet in the apartment, I will need to review my lease agreement and consult with my property manager to determine if it is allowed.\n\nThe apartment is fully furnished, but you are welcome to bring your own personal items to make it feel more like your own space.\n\nLastly, the apartment can be used as a home office, but you will need to sign a separate agreement with me to ensure that you are using the space in accordance with the terms of your lease.", "role": "user", "name": "Heinrich Heine"}]
