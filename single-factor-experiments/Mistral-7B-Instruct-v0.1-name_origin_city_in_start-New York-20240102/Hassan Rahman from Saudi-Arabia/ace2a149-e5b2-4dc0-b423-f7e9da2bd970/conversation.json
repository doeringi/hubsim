I am open to negotiating the rental price with you. However, I am afraid I cannot accept any lower than \u20ac1,500 per month, as this is the market rate for a 25 square meter apartment in New York. If you are willing to pay this price, I can provide you with a lease agreement and move forward with the rental process. Otherwise, I'm sorry to say that I will have to look for other tenants.
