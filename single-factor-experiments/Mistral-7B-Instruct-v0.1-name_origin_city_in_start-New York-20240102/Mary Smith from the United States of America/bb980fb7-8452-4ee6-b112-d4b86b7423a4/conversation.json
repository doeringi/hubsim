I appreciate your willingness to negotiate the rental price with me. However, as a landlord, I need to consider my expenses and maximize my profits. Based on the size and location of the apartment, I believe the original rental price of 1200 Euros per month is fair.\n\nThat being said, I am open to considering a lower rental price if you can provide a valid reason for your request. For example, if you can sign a longer lease term or if you can provide a security deposit, I may be able to offer a slightly lower rental price.\n\nUltimately, I want to ensure that both parties are satisfied with the rental agreement.
