However, I am open to discussing a lower price if you can provide evidence that you are a responsible tenant and will take good care of the apartment.\n\nAs for the condition of the apartment, I can assure you that it is in good condition and has been recently renovated. Additionally, I am a reliable landlord who will make sure that any issues are addressed promptly.\n\nRegarding the lease agreement, I am willing to work with you to find a flexible arrangement that suits your needs as a student. For example, we could consider a shorter lease term or the option to renew the lease at the end of each academic year.
