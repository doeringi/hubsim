I'm sure you'll find my apartment quite suitable for your needs. What price were you considering for the rental?", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Mister Schmidt, I believe that the location and condition of your apartment are quite good.

While I appreciate your budget, I must be honest with you. The going rate for apartments of this quality in the city center is typically higher.

Your willingness to negotiate has been commendable. To formalize our agreement, please provide me with your preferred method of payment for the deposit and the first month's rent. Once we have the payment details sorted, we can proceed with the lease signing.", "role": "user", "name": "Peter Schmidt from Germany"}, {"content": "Thank you, Mister Schmidt.
